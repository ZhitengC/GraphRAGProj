Previously, these two galaxies, at around 2% of the mass of the Milky Way, were considered too small to influence the Milky Way. However, in a computer model, the movement of these two galaxies creates a dark matter wake that amplifies their influence on the larger Milky Way.\n\nCurrent measurements suggest the Andromeda Galaxy is approaching us at 100 to 140 kilometers per second. In 3 to 4 billion years, there may be an Andromeda–Milky Way collision, depending on the importance of unknown lateral components to the galaxies' relative motion. If they collide, the chance of individual stars colliding with each other is extremely low, but instead the two galaxies will merge to form a single elliptical galaxy or perhaps a large disk galaxy  over the course of about a billion years.\n\nVelocity\n\nAlthough special relativity states that there is no \"preferred\" inertial frame of reference in space with which to compare the Milky Way, the Milky Way does have a velocity with respect to cosmological frames of reference.\n\nOne such frame of reference is the Hubble flow, the apparent motions of galaxy clusters due to the expansion of space. Individual galaxies, including the Milky Way, have peculiar velocities relative to the average flow. Thus, to compare the Milky Way to the Hubble flow, one must consider a volume large enough so that the expansion of the Universe dominates over local, random motions. A large enough volume means that the mean motion of galaxies within this volume is equal to the Hubble flow. Astronomers believe the Milky Way is moving at approximately 630 km per second with respect to this local co-moving frame of reference. The Milky Way is moving in the general direction of the Great Attractor and other galaxy clusters, including the Shapley supercluster, behind it.  The Local Group (a cluster of gravitationally bound galaxies containing, among others, the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy) is part of a supercluster called the Local Supercluster, centered near the Virgo Cluster: although they are moving away from each other at 967 km/s as part of the Hubble flow, this velocity is less than would be expected given the 16.8 million pc distance due to the gravitational attraction between the Local Group and the Virgo Cluster. \n\nAnother reference frame is provided by the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The Milky Way is moving at  with respect to the photons of the CMB, toward 10.5 right ascension, −24° declination (J2000 epoch, near the center of Hydra). This motion is observed by satellites such as the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) as a dipole contribution to the CMB, as photons in equilibrium in the CMB frame get blue-shifted in the direction of the motion and red-shifted in the opposite direction.\n\nEtymology and mythology\n\nIn Babylonia, the Milky Way was said to be the tail of Tiamat, set in the sky by Marduk after he had slain the salt water goddess.  It is believed this account, from the Enuma Elish had Marduk replace an earlier Sumerian story when Enlil of Nippur had slain the goddess.\n\nIn western culture the name \"Milky Way\" is derived from its appearance as a dim un-resolved \"milky\" glowing band arching across the night sky. The term is a translation of the Classical Latin via lactea, in turn derived from the Hellenistic Greek , short for  (', \"milky circle\"). The Ancient Greek  (') – from root -,  (\"milk\") +  (forming adjectives) – is also the root of \"galaxy\", the name for our, and later all such, collections of stars.  In Greek mythology it was supposedly made from the forceful suckling of Heracles, when Hera acted as a wetnurse for the hero.\n\nThe Milky Way, or \"milk circle\", was just one of 11 \"circles\" the Greeks identified in the sky, others being the zodiac, the meridian, the horizon, the equator, the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, Arctic and Antarctic circles, and two colure circles passing through both poles.\n\nAstronomical history\n\nIn Meteorologica (DK 59 A80), Aristotle (384–322 BC) wrote that the Greek philosophers Anaxagoras (–428 BC) and Democritus (460–370 BC) proposed that the Milky Way might consist of distant stars.  However, Aristotle himself believed the Milky Way to be caused by \"the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars which were large, numerous and close together\"  and that the \"ignition takes place in the upper part of the atmosphere, in the region of the world which is continuous with the heavenly motions.\"  The Neoplatonist philosopher Olympiodorus the Younger (–570 A.D.) criticized this view, arguing that if the Milky Way were sublunary, it should appear different at different times and places on Earth, and that it should have parallax, which it does not. In his view, the Milky Way is celestial. This idea would be influential later in the Islamic world.\n\nThe Persian astronomer Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī (973–1048) proposed that the Milky Way is \"a collection of countless fragments of the nature of nebulous stars\". The Andalusian astronomer Avempace ( 1138) proposed the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LARGE MAGELLANIC CLOUD<|>GEO<|>One of the two galaxies that orbit the Milky Way and cause a ripple or vibration as they pass through its edges)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMALL MAGELLANIC CLOUD<|>GEO<|>The other galaxy, along with the Large Magellanic Cloud, that orbits the Milky Way and creates a vibration when passing through its edges)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MILKY WAY<|>GEO<|>The galaxy that is influenced by the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, and is moving towards the Great Attractor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANDROMEDA GALAXY<|>GEO<|>A galaxy approaching the Milky Way at a speed of 100 to 140 kilometers per second, with a potential for a future collision)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUBBLE FLOW<|>EVENT<|>The apparent motion of galaxy clusters due to the expansion of space)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOCAL GROUP<|>GEO<|>A cluster of gravitationally bound galaxies, including the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOCAL SUPERCLUSTER<|>GEO<|>A supercluster that includes the Local Group and is centered near the Virgo Cluster)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRGO CLUSTER<|>GEO<|>A cluster of galaxies that is part of the Local Supercluster and is moving away from the Local Group)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREAT ATTRACTOR<|>GEO<|>A region in space towards which the Milky Way is moving)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SHAPLEY SUPERCLUSTER<|>GEO<|>Another galaxy cluster that is moving in the same direction as the Milky Way)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ABŪ RAYHĀN AL-BĪRŪNĪ<|>PERSON<|>Persian astronomer who proposed that the Milky Way is made up of countless fragments of nebulous stars)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AVEPACE<|>PERSON<|>Andalusian astronomer who proposed a theory about the nature of the Milky Way)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LARGE MAGELLANIC CLOUD<|>MILKY WAY<|>The Large Magellanic Cloud creates a dark matter wake that influences the Milky Way<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SMALL MAGELLANIC CLOUD<|>MILKY WAY<|>The Small Magellanic Cloud, along with the Large Magellanic Cloud, causes vibrations in the Milky Way<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ANDROMEDA GALAXY<|>MILKY WAY<|>The Andromeda Galaxy is approaching the Milky Way and may collide with it in the future<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MILKY WAY<|>HUBBLE FLOW<|>The Milky Way has a peculiar velocity relative to the Hubble flow<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOCAL GROUP<|>LOCAL SUPERCLUSTER<|>The Local Group is part of the Local Supercluster<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOCAL GROUP<|>VIRGO CLUSTER<|>The Local Group and the Virgo Cluster are moving away from each other as part of the Hubble flow<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ABŪ RAYHĀN AL-BĪRŪNĪ<|>MILKY WAY<|>Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī proposed a theory about the composition of the Milky Way<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AVEPACE<|>MILKY WAY<|>Avempace proposed a theory regarding the nature of the Milky Way<|>3)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
