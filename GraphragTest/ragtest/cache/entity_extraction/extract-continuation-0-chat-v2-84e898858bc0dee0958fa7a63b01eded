The Southwest Cargo Area, adjacent to Irving Park Road, accommodates over 80% of the airport's all-cargo flights, divided among 9 buildings in two tiers. The North Cargo Area, which is a modest conversion of the former military base (the 1943 Douglas plant area), also receives air freighters. It is adjacent to the northern portion of Bessie Coleman Drive.\n\nTwo satellite cargo areas have warehouse and build-up/tear down facilities, but aircraft do not park at these. Freight is trucked to/from aircraft on other ramps. The South Cargo Area is along Mannheim Road. The East Cargo Area, adjacent to Terminal 5, was formerly the airport's only cargo section but has now mostly evolved into an airport support zone.\n\nThe Southwest Cargo Area partially lies in the path of one of the new runways (10C/28C). The redevelopment of the airfield will entail moving/replacing this primary cargo hub.\n\nStatistics\n\nTop destinations\n\nAnnual traffic\n\nTransportation\n\nRail\n\nChicago 'L'\n\nThe Blue Line provides 'L' service between O'Hare and Forest Park, departing from an underground station accessible by pedestrian tunnels from Terminals 1, 2, and 3. The station opened on September 3, 1984. Trains run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, providing connection via downtown Chicago to Forest Park. \n\nMetra\n\nCommuter trains from the Metra North Central Service stop at the O'Hare Transfer station, which is connected to the Airport Transit System via a shuttle bus. Trains run only on weekdays.  \n\nAirport Express\n\nThe City of Chicago is looking into a plan for an express train that would take tourists, locals, and other travelers from downtown Chicago to O'Hare International Airport in about 20 minutes, which is half the time it takes on the City's Blue Line. If an express train does get built, one-time tickets would likely cost around $30 to $35. Less expensive monthly passes and family discounts might also become available.  The City will look for a private company to cover construction costs and operate the system, but it's likely public money would go into building stations at the airport and downtown if the project moves ahead. The city says an engineering firm will spend the next 10 months evaluating potential routes, drafting designs and coming up with a construction timeline and cost estimate, then put it out for bid in 2017. In the early 1990s, the idea of a 20-minute O'Hare express train service has been proposed. Some plans included bypass tracks on the CTA Blue Line that run down the middle of the Kennedy Expressway as well as use of a Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way near the Kennedy. However no plans were ever materialized. \n\nCar\n\nRoad vehicles enter and exit via I-190, which branches off I-90 (the Kennedy Expressway) leading to downtown Chicago. Cars may also access the airport locally from Mannheim Road, the airport's eastern boundary. Aside from cargo access on its south side, all airport traffic travels through the east side of the airport. Local residents sometimes refer to I-190 as \"the world's busiest Cul-de-sac\" as a result of the one way access.\n\nTaxi\n\nTaxi and Limo Services also provide transportation to/from Chicago O'Hare Airport. Fares vary based on traffic, average fares from O'Hare to downtown Chicago are $30–$40. \n\nBus\n\nRegional buses, taking passengers to Indiana, Iowa, and Wisconsin arrive and depart from the Bus / Shuttle Center.  It is located on the ground level of the Main Parking Garage, accessible by pedestrian tunnels from Terminals 1, 2, and 3.\n\nCell Phone Lot\n\nA cell phone lot can be reached via the  Car Rental return/Bessie Coleman dr.  exit off the I-190. Signs direct drivers to the new Cell Phone Lot.  On the west side of Bessie Coleman across from car rentals  one half mile north of the exit. An information display provides arrival time updates. \n\nModernization plan\n\nO'Hare's high volume and crowded schedule can lead to long delays and cancellations that, due to the airport being a major hub, can have a ripple effect on air travel across North America. Official reports rank O'Hare as one of the least punctual airports in the United States based on percentage of delayed flights.  In 2004, United Airlines and American Airlines agreed to modify their flight schedules to help reduce congestion caused by clustered arrivals and departures. Because of the air traffic departing, arriving, and near the airport, air traffic controllers at O'Hare and its nearby facilities are among the leaders in the world in terms of number of controlled flights handled per hour.\n\nCity management has committed to a $6 billion capital investment plan to increase the airport's capacity by 60% and decrease delays by an estimated 79 percent.  This plan was approved by the FAA in October 2005 and will involve a reconfiguration of the airfield and addition of terminal space. The plan includes the addition of four runways, the lengthening of two existing runways, and the decommissioning of two existing runways in order to give the airfield six parallel runways in a configuration similar to that used at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, and other large modern hub airports. This plan was very controversial as the added improvements, at the time they were proposed, were expected to increase the airport's air traffic capacity only slightly, given existing FAA rules. Additionally, the southernmost new runway would require the city acquiring additional land, which was extremely controversial as residents did not want to move.\n\nThe Modernization Plan\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SOUTHWEST CARGO AREA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Southwest Cargo Area at O'Hare is a major hub for all-cargo flights with extensive warehouse and aircraft parking facilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH CARGO AREA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Converted from a military base, the North Cargo Area also handles air freighters and is located near Bessie Coleman Drive)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTH CARGO AREA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The South Cargo Area has warehouse facilities and is situated along Mannheim Road)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EAST CARGO AREA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The East Cargo Area, once the main cargo section, is now an airport support zone adjacent to Terminal 5)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>O'HARE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT<|>GEO<|>A major airport in Chicago with significant cargo and passenger operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHICAGO<|>GEO<|>The city where O'Hare International Airport is located, and the location for the City's management of the airport)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLUE LINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Blue Line provides 'L' train service between O'Hare and Forest Park, with trains running 24/7)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>METRA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Metra provides commuter train services, including to the O'Hare Transfer station)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY OF CHICAGO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The governing body planning and managing the airport's modernization and the potential express train project)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AIRPORT EXPRESS<|>EVENT<|>A proposed express train project to transport travelers from downtown Chicago to O'Hare International Airport in 20 minutes)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTHWEST CARGO AREA<|>O'HARE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT<|>The Southwest Cargo Area is part of O'Hare International Airport<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH CARGO AREA<|>O'HARE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT<|>The North Cargo Area is part of O'Hare International Airport<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EAST CARGO AREA<|>O'HARE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT<|>The East Cargo Area is part of O'Hare International Airport<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTH CARGO AREA<|>O'HARE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT<|>The South Cargo Area is part of O'Hare International Airport<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLUE LINE<|>O'HARE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT<|>The Blue Line provides transportation to O'Hare International Airport<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>METRA<|>O'HARE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT<|>Metra's North Central Service stops at O'Hare Transfer station<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CITY OF CHICAGO<|>O'HARE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT<|>The City of Chicago manages and is planning the modernization of O'Hare International Airport<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AIRPORT EXPRESS<|>CITY OF CHICAGO<|>The City of Chicago is considering the Airport Express train project<|>6)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
