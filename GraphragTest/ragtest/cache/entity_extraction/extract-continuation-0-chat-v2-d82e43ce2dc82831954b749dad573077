Denali National Park and Preserve is located here. Denali is the highest mountain in North America.\n\nSouthwest\n\nSouthwest Alaska is a sparsely inhabited region stretching some 500 mi inland from the Bering Sea. Most of the population lives along the coast. Kodiak Island is also located in Southwest. The massive Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta, one of the largest river deltas in the world, is here.  Portions of the Alaska Peninsula are considered part of Southwest, with the remaining portions included with the Aleutian Islands (see below).\n\nNorth Slope\n\nThe North Slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages. The area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil, and contains both the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska and the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field.  Barrow, the northernmost city in the United States, is located here. The Northwest Arctic area, anchored by Kotzebue and also containing the Kobuk River valley, is often regarded as being part of this region.  However, the respective Inupiat of the North Slope and of the Northwest Arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people.\n\nAleutian Islands\n\nMore than 300 small volcanic islands make up this chain, which stretches over 1200 mi into the Pacific Ocean. Some of these islands fall in the Eastern Hemisphere, but the International Date Line was drawn west of 180° to keep the whole state, and thus the entire North American continent, within the same legal day. Two of the islands, Attu and Kiska, were occupied by Japanese forces during World War II.\n\nNatural features\n\nWith its myriad islands, Alaska has nearly 34000 mi of tidal shoreline. The Aleutian Islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula. Many active volcanoes are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions. Unimak Island, for example, is home to Mount Shishaldin, which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to 10000 ft above the North Pacific. It is the most perfect volcanic cone on Earth, even more symmetrical than Japan's Mount Fuji. The chain of volcanoes extends to Mount Spurr, west of Anchorage on the mainland. Geologists have identified Alaska as part of Wrangellia, a large region consisting of multiple states and Canadian provinces in the Pacific Northwest, which is actively undergoing continent building.\n\nOne of the world's largest tides occurs in Turnagain Arm, just south of Anchorage – tidal differences can be more than 35 ft. \n\nAlaska has more than three million lakes.  Marshlands and wetland permafrost cover 188320 sqmi (mostly in northern, western and southwest flatlands). Glacier ice covers some 16000 sqmi of land and 1200 sqmi of tidal zone. The Bering Glacier complex near the southeastern border with Yukon covers 2250 sqmi alone. With over 100,000 glaciers, Alaska has half of all in the world.\n\nLand ownership\n\nAccording to an October 1998 report by the United States Bureau of Land Management, approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the U.S. federal government as public lands, including a multitude of national forests, national parks, and national wildlife refuges.  Of these, the Bureau of Land Management manages 87 e6acre, or 23.8% of the state. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. It is the world's largest wildlife refuge, comprising 16 e6acre.\n\nOf the remaining land area, the state of Alaska owns 101 e6acre, its entitlement under the Alaska Statehood Act.  A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to organized boroughs, under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs.  Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities. These are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations.  The University of Alaska, as a land grant university, also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently.\n\nAnother 44 e6acre are owned by 12 regional, and scores of local, Native corporations created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971. Regional Native corporation Doyon, Limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications.  Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations' land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect. Effectively, the corporations hold title (including subsurface title in many cases, a privilege denied to individual Alaskans) but cannot sell the land. Individual Native allotments can be and are sold on the open market, however.\n\nVarious private interests own the remaining land, totaling about one percent of the state.  Alaska is, by a large margin, the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when Native corporation holdings are excluded.\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate in Southeast Alaska is a mid-latitude oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb) in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate (Köppen Cfc) in the northern parts. On an annual basis, Southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year. Juneau averages over 50 in of precipitation a year, and Ketchikan averages over 150 in.  This is also the only region in Alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months.\n\nThe climate of Anchorage and south central Alaska is mild by Alaskan standards due to the region's proximity to the seacoast. While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska, it gets more snow, and days tend to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DENALI NATIONAL PARK AND PRESERVE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Denali National Park and Preserve is a protected area that includes Denali, the highest mountain in North America)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTHWEST ALASKA<|>GEO<|>A sparsely inhabited region of Alaska, stretching inland from the Bering Sea, and including Kodiak Island and the Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERING SEA<|>GEO<|>The body of water that borders Southwest Alaska)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KODIAK ISLAND<|>GEO<|>An island located in Southwest Alaska)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YUKON–KUSKOKWIM DELTA<|>GEO<|>One of the largest river deltas in the world, located in Southwest Alaska)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALASKA PENINSULA<|>GEO<|>A region that is partly considered part of Southwest Alaska and partly included with the Aleutian Islands)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH SLOPE<|>GEO<|>A region known for its tundra and crude oil reserves, including the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska and the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BARROW<|>GEO<|>The northernmost city in the United States, located on the North Slope)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTHWEST ARCTIC<|>GEO<|>An area that is often regarded as part of the North Slope region)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALEUTIAN ISLANDS<|>GEO<|>A chain of over 300 volcanic islands extending into the Pacific Ocean from Alaska)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATTU<|>GEO<|>An island in the Aleutian Islands that was occupied by Japanese forces during World War II)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KISKA<|>GEO<|>An island in the Aleutian Islands that was occupied by Japanese forces during World War II)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNAGAIN ARM<|>GEO<|>A location south of Anchorage known for one of the world's largest tides)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANCHORAGE<|>GEO<|>A city in Alaska, located near Turnagain Arm)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BERING GLACIER COMPLEX<|>GEO<|>A large glacier complex near the southeastern border of Alaska with Yukon)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED STATES BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A bureau that manages approximately 65% of Alaska as public lands)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The world's largest wildlife refuge, managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A land grant university that owns and manages substantial acreage in Alaska)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOYON, LIMITED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A regional Native corporation that is one of the largest private landowners in Alaska)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DENALI NATIONAL PARK AND PRESERVE<|>DENALI<|>Denali, the highest mountain, is located within Denali National Park and Preserve<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOUTHWEST ALASKA<|>BERING SEA<|>Southwest Alaska stretches inland from the Bering Sea<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KODIAK ISLAND<|>SOUTHWEST ALASKA<|>Kodiak Island is located in Southwest Alaska<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YUKON–KUSKOKWIM DELTA<|>SOUTHWEST ALASKA<|>The Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta is located in Southwest Alaska<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALASKA PENINSULA<|>SOUTHWEST ALASKA<|>Part of the Alaska Peninsula is considered part of Southwest Alaska<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH SLOPE<|>BARROW<|>Barrow is the northernmost city in the United States, located on the North Slope<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTHWEST ARCTIC<|>NORTH SLOPE<|>The Northwest Arctic is often regarded as part of the North Slope<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALEUTIAN ISLANDS<|>ALASKA PENINSULA<|>The Aleutian Islands extend from the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ATTU<|>ALEUTIAN ISLANDS<|>Attu is one of the islands in the Aleutian Islands<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KISKA<|>ALEUTIAN ISLANDS<|>Kiska is one of the islands in the Aleutian Islands<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TURNAGAIN ARM<|>ANCHORAGE<|>Turnagain Arm is located south of Anchorage<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERING GLACIER COMPLEX<|>YUKON<|>The Bering Glacier complex is near the southeastern border of Alaska with Yukon<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNITED STATES BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT<|>ALASKA<|>The Bureau of Land Management manages approximately 65% of Alaska<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE<|>UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE<|>The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA<|>ALASKA<|>The University of Alaska owns and manages substantial acreage in the state<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOYON, LIMITED<|>ALASKA<|>Doyon, Limited is one of the largest private landowners in Alaska<|>6)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
