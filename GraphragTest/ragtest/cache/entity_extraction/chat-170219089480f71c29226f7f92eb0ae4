The Austrian and the Hungarian lands became independent entities enjoying equal status  Under this arrangement, the Hungarians referred to their ruler as king and never emperor (see k. u. k.).  This prevailed until the Habsburgs' deposition from both Austria and Hungary in 1918 following defeat in World War I.\n\nOn 11 November 1918, with his empire collapsing around him, the last Habsburg ruler, Charles I (who also reigned as Charles IV of Hungary) issued a proclamation recognizing Austria's right to determine the future of the state and renouncing any role in state affairs.  Two days later, he issued a separate proclamation for Hungary.  Even though he did not officially abdicate, this is considered the end of the Habsburg dynasty.  In 1919, the new republican Austrian government subsequently passed a law banishing the Habsburgs from Austrian territory until they renounced all intentions of regaining the throne and accepted the status of private citizens.  Charles made several attempts to regain the throne of Hungary, and in 1921 the Hungarian government passed a law which revoked Charles' rights and dethroned the Habsburgs.\n\nThe Habsburgs did not formally abandon all hope of returning to power until Otto von Habsburg, Emperor Charles' eldest son, renounced all claims to the throne.\n\nThe dynasty's motto, \"Leave the waging of wars to others!  But you, happy Austria, marry; for the realms which Mars awards to others, Venus transfers to you.\",  indicates the knack of the Habsburgs to have members intermarry into other royal houses in order to build alliances and inherit territory. Empress Maria Theresa is recognized quite notably for it and is sometimes referred to as the \"Great-Grandmother of Europe\".\n\nFamily tree\n\nSimilarly, this family tree only includes male scions of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine who survived to adulthood:\n\nMonarchs of the House of Habsburg\n\nThe Habsburg Empire was never composed of a single unified and unitary state as Bourbon France, Hohenzollern Germany, or Great Britain was.  It was made up of an accretion of territories that owed their historic loyalty to the head of the house of Habsburg as hereditary lord.  The Habsburgs had mostly married the heiresses of these territories, most famously of Spain and the Netherlands.  They used their coats of arms then as a statement of their right to rule all these territories.  As there were many territories, so their arms were complex and reflected the waxing and waning position of the Habsburgs within European power politics.  It was not until the 19th century (see below Arms of Dominion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) that the arms began to take on their own life as symbols of a state which may have an existence outside of the Habsburg dynasty.  A complete listing of the arms can be found at the Habsburg Armory.\n\nAncestors\n\n* Guntram the Rich (ca. 930–985 / 990) Father of:\n* Lanzelin of Altenburg (died 991).
