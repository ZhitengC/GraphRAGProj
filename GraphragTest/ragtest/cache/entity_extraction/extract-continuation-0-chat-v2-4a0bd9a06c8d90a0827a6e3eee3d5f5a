Donald is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a sailor shirt and cap with a bow tie. Donald is most famous for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and temperamental personality. Along with his friend Mickey Mouse, Donald is one of the most popular Disney characters and was included in TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002.  He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character,  and is the most published comic book character in the world outside of the superhero genre. \n\nDonald Duck rose to fame with his comedic roles in animated cartoons. Donald's first appearance was in 1934 in The Wise Little Hen, but it was his second appearance in Orphan's Benefit which introduced him as a temperamental comic foil to Mickey Mouse. Throughout the next two decades Donald appeared in over 150 theatrical films, several of which were recognized at the Academy Awards. In the 1930s, he typically appeared as part of a comic trio with Mickey and Goofy, and was given his own film series in 1937 starting with Don Donald. These films introduced Donald's love interest Daisy Duck and often included his three nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie. After the 1956 film Chips Ahoy, Donald appeared primarily in educational films before eventually returning to theatrical animation in Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983). His most recent appearance in a theatrical film was 1999's Fantasia 2000. Donald has also appeared in direct-to-video features such as Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers (2004), television series such as Mickey Mouse Clubhouse (2006–2013), and video games such as QuackShot (1991). \n\nBeyond animation Donald is primarily known for his appearances in comics. Donald was most famously drawn by Al Taliaferro, Carl Barks, and Don Rosa. Barks in particular is credited for greatly expanding the \"Donald Duck universe\", the world in which Donald lives, and creating many additional characters such as Donald's rich uncle Scrooge McDuck. Donald has been a very popular character in Europe, particularly in Nordic countries where his weekly magazine Donald Duck & Co was the most popular comics publication from the 1950s to 2009. Disney comics' fandom is sometimes referred to as \"Donaldism\", a term which originated in Norway ().  \n\nOrigin\n\nThe origins of Donald Duck's name may have been inspired by Australian cricket legend Donald Bradman. In 1932 Bradman and the Australian team were touring North America and he made the news after being dismissed for a duck against New York West Indians. Walt Disney was in the process of creating a friend for Mickey Mouse when he possibly read about Bradman's dismissal in the papers and decided to name the new character \"Donald Duck\".  Voice performer Clarence Nash auditioned for Walt Disney Studios when he learned that Disney was looking for people to create animal sounds for his cartoons. Disney was particularly impressed with Nash's duck imitation and chose him to voice the new character. Besides, during that period Mickey Mouse had lost some of his edge since becoming a role model towards children, and so Disney wanted to create a character to portray some of the more negative character traits that could no longer be bestowed on Mickey. Disney came up with Donald's iconic attributes including his short-temper and his sailor suit (based on ducks and sailors both being associated with water).  While Dick Huemer and Art Babbit were first to animate Donald, Dick Lundy is credited for developing him as a character.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nPersonality\n\nDonald's two dominant personality traits are his short temper and his positive outlook on life. Many Donald shorts start with Donald in a happy mood, without a care in the world until something comes along and spoils his day. His anger is a great cause of suffering in his life. On multiple occasions, it has caused him to get in over his head and lose competitions. There are times when he fights to keep his temper in check, and he sometimes succeeds in doing so temporarily, but he always returns to his normal angry self in the end.\n\nDonald's aggressive nature has its advantages, however. While at times it is a hindrance, and even a handicap, it has also helped him in times of need. When faced with a threat of some kind, for example Pete's attempts to intimidate him, he is initially scared, but his fear is replaced by anger. As a result, instead of running away, he fights—with ghosts, sharks, mountain goats, giant kites, and even the forces of nature. And, more often than not, when he fights, he comes out on top.\n\nDonald is something of a prankster, and as a result, he can sometimes come across as a bit of a bully, especially in the way he sometimes treats his nephews and Chip 'n' Dale. As the animator Fred Spencer has put it:\n\nHowever, with a few exceptions, there is seldom any malice in Donald's pranks. He almost never intends to hurt anyone, and whenever his pranks go too far, he is always very regretful. In Truant Officer Donald, for example, when he is tricked into believing he has accidentally killed Huey, Dewey and Louie, he shows great remorse, blaming himself. His nephews appear in the form of angels, and he willingly endures a kick by one of them—that is, of course, until he realizes he has been played for a sap, whereupon he promptly loses his temper.\n\nDonald is also a bit of a show-off. He likes to brag, especially about how skilled he is at something. He does in fact have many skills—he is something of a Jack of all Trades.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DONALD DUCK<|>PERSON<|>Donald Duck is a cartoon character created at Walt Disney Productions, known for his semi-intelligible speech and mischievous personality)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALT DISNEY PRODUCTIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Walt Disney Productions is the company that created Donald Duck)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICKEY MOUSE<|>PERSON<|>Mickey Mouse is a Disney character and friend of Donald Duck)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAISY DUCK<|>PERSON<|>Daisy Duck is Donald Duck's love interest)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HUEY<|>PERSON<|>Huey is one of Donald Duck's nephews)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEWEY<|>PERSON<|>Dewey is one of Donald Duck's nephews)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOUIE<|>PERSON<|>Louie is one of Donald Duck's nephews)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AL TALIAFERRO<|>PERSON<|>Al Taliaferro is one of the artists who drew Donald Duck comics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARL BARKS<|>PERSON<|>Carl Barks is an artist who expanded the Donald Duck universe and created additional characters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCROOGE MCDUCK<|>PERSON<|>Scrooge McDuck is Donald Duck's rich uncle, created by Carl Barks)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD DUCK<|>WALT DISNEY PRODUCTIONS<|>Donald Duck was created by Walt Disney Productions<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD DUCK<|>MICKEY MOUSE<|>Donald Duck is a friend of Mickey Mouse and often appears with him<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD DUCK<|>DAISY DUCK<|>Donald Duck has a romantic relationship with Daisy Duck<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD DUCK<|>HUEY<|>Huey is one of Donald Duck's nephews<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD DUCK<|>DEWEY<|>Dewey is one of Donald Duck's nephews<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD DUCK<|>LOUIE<|>Louie is one of Donald Duck's nephews<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD DUCK<|>AL TALIAFERRO<|>Al Taliaferro has drawn Donald Duck in comics<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD DUCK<|>CARL BARKS<|>Carl Barks greatly expanded the Donald Duck universe<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CARL BARKS<|>SCROOGE MCDUCK<|>Carl Barks created Scrooge McDuck<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONALD DUCK<|>SCROOGE MCDUCK<|>Scrooge McDuck is Donald Duck's uncle<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
