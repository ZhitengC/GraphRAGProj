Its name \"milky\" is derived from its appearance as a dim glowing band arching across the night sky whose individual stars cannot be distinguished by the naked eye. The term \"Milky Way\" is a translation of the Latin ', from the Greek  (', \"milky circle\"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies—now estimated to number as many as 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe. \n\nThe Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy that has a diameter usually considered to be about 100,000–120,000 light-years  but may be 150,000–180,000 light-years.  The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars,   although this number may be as high as one trillion.  There are likely at least 100 billion planets in the Milky Way.  The Solar System is located within the disk, about 27,000 light-years from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge of one of the spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust called the Orion Arm. The stars in the inner ≈10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. The very center is marked by an intense radio source, named Sagittarius A*, which is likely to be a supermassive black hole.\n\nStars and gases at a wide range of distances from the Galactic Center orbit at approximately 220 kilometers per second. The constant rotation speed contradicts the laws of Keplerian dynamics and suggests that much of the mass of the Milky Way does not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation. This mass has been termed \"dark matter\". The rotational period is about 240 million years at the position of the Sun. The Milky Way as a whole is moving at a velocity of approximately 600 km per second with respect to extragalactic frames of reference. The oldest stars in the Milky Way are nearly as old as the Universe itself and thus likely formed shortly after the Dark Ages of the Big Bang.\n\nThe Milky Way has several satellite galaxies and is part of the Local Group of galaxies, which is a component of the Virgo Supercluster, which is itself a component of the Laniakea Supercluster.  \n\nAppearance\n\nThe \"Milky Way\" can be seen as a hazy band of white light some 30 degrees wide arcing across the sky. Although all the individual naked-eye stars in the entire sky are part of the Milky Way,  the light in this band originates from the accumulation of unresolved stars and other material located in the direction of the galactic plane. Dark regions within the band, such as the Great Rift and the Coalsack, are areas where light from distant stars is blocked by interstellar dust. The area of the sky obscured by the Milky Way is called the Zone of Avoidance.\n\nThe Milky Way has a relatively low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or stray light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond in order for the Milky Way to be seen.  It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1. This makes the Milky Way difficult to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon. The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more than one third of Earth population cannot see the Milky Way from their homes due to light pollution. \n\nAs viewed from Earth, the visible region of the Milky Way's Galactic plane occupies an area of the sky that includes 30 constellations.  The center of the Galaxy lies in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius; it is here that the Milky Way is brightest. From Sagittarius, the hazy band of white light appears to pass around to the Galactic anticenter in Auriga. The band then continues the rest of the way around the sky, back to Sagittarius. The band divides the night sky into two roughly equal hemispheres.\n\nThe Galactic plane is inclined by about 60 degrees to the ecliptic (the plane of Earth's orbit). Relative to the celestial equator, it passes as far north as the constellation of Cassiopeia and as far south as the constellation of Crux, indicating the high inclination of Earth’s equatorial plane and the plane of the ecliptic, relative to the Galactic plane. The north Galactic pole is situated at right ascension 12h 49m, declination +27.4° (B1950) near β Comae Berenices, and the south Galactic pole is near α Sculptoris. Because of this high inclination, depending on the time of night and year, the arc of Milky Way may appear relatively low or relatively high in the sky. For observers from approximately 65 degrees north to 65 degrees south on Earth's surface, the Milky Way passes directly overhead twice a day.\n\nSize and mass\n\nThe Milky Way is the second-largest galaxy in the Local Group, with its stellar disk approximately 100000 ly in diameter, and, on average, approximately 1000 ly thick.  As a guide to the relative physical scale of the Milky Way, if the Solar System out to Neptune were the size of a US quarter (25mm),\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MILKY WAY<|>GEO<|>The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy containing our Solar System and is one of many galaxies in the observable universe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GALILEO GALILEI<|>PERSON<|>Galileo Galilei was an astronomer who first resolved the band of light of the Milky Way into individual stars)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HARLOW SHAPLEY<|>PERSON<|>Harlow Shapley was an astronomer involved in the 1920 Great Debate regarding the nature of the Milky Way)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEBER CURTIS<|>PERSON<|>Heber Curtis was an astronomer involved in the 1920 Great Debate regarding the nature of the Milky Way)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDWIN HUBBLE<|>PERSON<|>Edwin Hubble was an astronomer whose observations showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOLAR SYSTEM<|>GEO<|>Our Solar System is located within the disk of the Milky Way, on the inner edge of the Orion Arm)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAGITTARIUS A*<|>GEO<|>An intense radio source at the center of the Milky Way, likely a supermassive black hole)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOCAL GROUP<|>GEO<|>A group of galaxies that includes the Milky Way)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRGO SUPERCLUSTER<|>GEO<|>A supercluster of galaxies that includes the Local Group)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LANIAKEA SUPERCLUSTER<|>GEO<|>A supercluster of galaxies that includes the Virgo Supercluster)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GALILEO GALILEI<|>MILKY WAY<|>Galileo Galilei observed and resolved the stars of the Milky Way<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HARLOW SHAPLEY<|>EDWIN HUBBLE<|>Harlow Shapley and Edwin Hubble were involved in the 1920 Great Debate about the Milky Way<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEBER CURTIS<|>EDWIN HUBBLE<|>Heber Curtis and Edwin Hubble were involved in the 1920 Great Debate about the Milky Way<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MILKY WAY<|>LOCAL GROUP<|>The Milky Way is part of the Local Group of galaxies<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOCAL GROUP<|>VIRGO SUPERCLUSTER<|>The Local Group is a component of the Virgo Supercluster<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIRGO SUPERCLUSTER<|>LANIAKEA SUPERCLUSTER<|>The Virgo Supercluster is a component of the Laniakea Supercluster<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOLAR SYSTEM<|>MILKY WAY<|>The Solar System is located within the disk of the Milky Way<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAGITTARIUS A*<|>MILKY WAY<|>Sagittarius A* is located at the center of the Milky Way<|>8)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
