As a result, an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches gradually became established within Alaska.  Alaska also has the largest Quaker population (by percentage) of any state.  In 2009 there were 6,000 Jews in Alaska (for whom observance of halakha may pose special problems).  Alaskan Hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other Asian religious communities, including Sikhs and Jains.   \n\nEstimates for the number of Muslims in Alaska range from 2,000 to 5,000.     The Islamic Community Center of Anchorage began efforts in the late 1990s to construct a mosque in Anchorage.  They broke ground on a building in south Anchorage in 2010 and were nearing completion in late 2014.  When completed, the mosque will be the first in the state and one of the northernmost mosques in the world. \n\nEconomy\n\nThe 2007 gross state product was $44.9 billion, 45th in the nation. Its per capita personal income for 2007 was $40,042, ranking 15th in the nation. According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International, Alaska had the fifth-largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 6.75 percent.  The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with more than 80% of the state's revenues derived from petroleum extraction. Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab.\n\nAgriculture represents a very small fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.\n\nEmployment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in the Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island boroughs, as well as Kodiak. Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector. Tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging.\n\nEnergy\n\nAlaska has vast energy resources, although its oil reserves have been largely depleted. Major oil and gas reserves were found in the Alaska North Slope (ANS) and Cook Inlet basins, but according to the Energy Information Administration, by February 2014 Alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after Texas, North Dakota, and California.   Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's North Slope is still the second highest-yielding oil field in the United States, typically producing about 400000 oilbbl/d, although by early 2014 North Dakota's Bakken Formation was producing over 900000 oilbbl/d.  Prudhoe Bay was the largest conventional oil field ever discovered in North America, but was much smaller than Canada's enormous Athabasca oil sands field, which by 2014 was producing about  of unconventional oil, and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate. \n\nThe Trans-Alaska Pipeline can transport and pump up to  of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States. Additionally, substantial coal deposits are found in Alaska's bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal basins.  The United States Geological Survey estimates that there are  of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope.  Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers. Large swaths of the Alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well. \n\nAlaska's economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electric power and light. Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for statewide energy systems (e.g. with special low-cost electric interties) were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50¢/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population.  The cost of a gallon of gas in urban Alaska today is usually 30–60¢ higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors.\n\nPermanent Fund\n\nThe Alaska Permanent Fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil, largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.  The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900 million) at once. It was later championed by Governor Jay Hammond and Kenai state representative Hugh Malone.  It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.\n\nThe Alaska Constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose.  The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation.  From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $50 billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.  Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALASKA<|>GEO<|>Alaska is a state in the United States known for its diverse religious communities and rich natural resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCHES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Russian Orthodox churches established in Alaska to serve the Russian immigrant community)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUAKER POPULATION<|>PERSON<|>Refers to the largest population of Quakers by percentage in the United States, located in Alaska)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JEWS<|>PERSON<|>Around 6,000 Jews living in Alaska, facing unique challenges in observing their faith)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HINDUS<|>PERSON<|>Hindus in Alaska who often engage in shared activities with other Asian religious groups)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIKHS<|>PERSON<|>One of the Asian religious communities in Alaska that sometimes shares venues with Hindus and Jains)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAINS<|>PERSON<|>Another Asian religious community in Alaska that may share events with Hindus and Sikhs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MUSLIMS<|>PERSON<|>An estimated 2,000 to 5,000 Muslims in Alaska, with the Islamic Community Center of Anchorage attempting to build the first mosque in the state)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISLAMIC COMMUNITY CENTER OF ANCHORAGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Islamic Community Center of Anchorage, which started the construction of a mosque in south Anchorage)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANCHORAGE<|>GEO<|>The largest city in Alaska, where the Islamic Community Center is located)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENERGY RESOURCES<|>GEO<|>Vast energy resources in Alaska, including oil, gas, coal, and renewable energy sources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Industry that dominates the Alaskan economy, providing over 80% of the state's revenue)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANS-ALASKA PIPELINE<|>GEO<|>A major infrastructure project capable of transporting large amounts of crude oil per day)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALASKA PERMANENT FUND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A constitutionally authorized fund to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALASKA<|>RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCHES<|>Russian Orthodox churches became established in Alaska due to the presence of Russian immigrants<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALASKA<|>QUAKER POPULATION<|>Alaska has the largest Quaker population by percentage in the United States<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALASKA<|>JEWS<|>Alaska has a Jewish population that faces unique challenges in religious observance<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALASKA<|>HINDUS<|>Hindus in Alaska engage with other Asian religious communities<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALASKA<|>SIKHS<|>Sikhs are part of the Asian religious communities in Alaska<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALASKA<|>JAINS<|>Jains are part of the Asian religious communities in Alaska<|>2)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALASKA<|>MUSLIMS<|>An estimated number of Muslims reside in Alaska, with the Islamic Community Center working on building a mosque<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ISLAMIC COMMUNITY CENTER OF ANCHORAGE<|>ANCHORAGE<|>The Islamic Community Center is based in Anchorage and is constructing a mosque there<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENERGY RESOURCES<|>OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY<|>The oil and gas industry in Alaska relies on the state's vast energy resources<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALASKA<|>TRANS-ALASKA PIPELINE<|>The Trans-Alaska Pipeline is a significant infrastructure in Alaska for transporting crude oil<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALASKA PERMANENT FUND<|>OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY<|>The Permanent Fund manages surplus from the oil and gas industry in Alaska<|>7)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
