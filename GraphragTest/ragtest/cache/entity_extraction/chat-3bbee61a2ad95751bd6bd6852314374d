The conservative Mexican nobility, as well as the clergy, supported this Second Mexican Empire. His consort, Charlotte of Belgium, a daughter of King Leopold I of Belgium and a princess of the House of Saxe-Coburg Gotha, encouraged her husband's acceptance of the Mexican crown and accompanied him as Empress Carlota of Mexico.

Therefore, the kings of Hungary are listed separately.\n\nAlbertine line: Kings of Hungary\n\n* Albert, king of Hungary 1437–1439\n* Ladislaus V Posthumus, King of Hungary 1444–1457\n\nAustrian Habsburgs: Kings of Hungary\n\n* Ferdinand I, king of Hungary 1526–1564\n* Maximilian I, king of Hungary 1563–1576\n* Rudolf I, king of Hungary 1572–1608\n* Matthias II, king of Hungary 1608–1619\n* Ferdinand II, king of Hungary 1618–1637\n* Ferdinand III, king of Hungary 1625–1657\n* Ferdinand IV, king of Hungary 1647–1654\n* Leopold I, king of Hungary 1655–1705\n* Joseph I, king of Hungary 1687–1711\n* Charles III, king of Hungary 1711–1740\n* Maria Theresa, queen of Hungary 1741–1780\n\nHouse of Habsburg-Lorraine, main line: Kings of Hungary\n\n* Joseph II, king of Hungary 1780–1790\n* Leopold II, king of Hungary 1790–1792\n* Francis, king of Hungary 1792–1835\n* Ferdinand V, king of Hungary and Bohemia 1835–1848\n* Francis Joseph I, king of Hungary 1867–1916\n* Charles IV, king of Hungary 1916–1918\n\nKings of Bohemia \n\nThe kingship of Bohemia was from 1306 a position elected by its nobles. As a result, it was not an automatically inherited position. Until the rule of Ferdinand I, Habsburgs didn't gain hereditary accession to the throne and were displaced by other dynasties. Hence, the kings of Bohemia and their ruling dates are listed separately. The Habsburgs became hereditary kings of Bohemia in 1627.
