“美猴王”。\n　　美猴王每天带着猴子们游山玩水，很快三、五百年过去了。一天正在玩乐时，美猴王想到自己将来难免一死，不由悲伤得掉下眼泪来，这时猴群中跳出个通背猿猴来，说∶“大王想要长生不老，只有去学佛、学仙、学神之术。”\n　　美猴王决定走遍天涯海角，也要找到神仙，学那长生不老的本领。第二天，猴子们为他做了一个木筏，又准备了一些野果，于是美猴王告别了群猴们，一个人撑着木筏，奔向汪洋大海。\n　　大概是美猴王的运气好，连日的东南风，将他送到西北岸边。他下了木筏，登上了岸，看见岸边有许多人都在干活，有的捉鱼，有的打天上的大雁，有的挖蛤蜊，有的淘盐，他悄悄地走过去，没想到，吓得那些人将东西一扔，四处逃命。\n　　这一天，他来到一座高山前，突然从半山腰的树林里传出一阵美妙的歌声，唱的是一些关于成仙的话。猴王想∶这个唱歌的人一定是神仙，就顺着歌声找去。\n　　唱歌的是一个正在树林里砍柴的青年人，猴王从这青年人的口中了解到，这座山叫灵台方寸山，离这儿七八里路，有个斜月三星洞，洞中住着一个称为菩提祖师的神仙。\n　　美猴王告别打柴的青年人，出了树林，走过山坡，果然远远地看见一座洞府，只见洞门紧紧地闭着，洞门对面的山岗上立着一块石碑，大约有三丈多高，八尺多宽，上面写着十个大字∶“灵台方寸山斜月三星洞”。正在看时，门却忽然打开了，走出来一个仙童。\n　　美猴王赶快走上前，深深地鞠了一个躬，说明来意，那仙童说∶“我师父刚才正要讲道，忽然叫我出来开门，说外面来了个拜师学艺的，原来就是你呀！跟我来吧！”美猴王赶紧整整衣服，恭恭敬敬地跟着仙童进到洞内，来到祖师讲道的法台跟前。\n　　猴王看见菩提祖师端端正正地坐在台上，台下两边站着三十多个仙童，就赶紧跪下叩头。祖师问清楚他的来意，很高兴，见他没有姓名，便说∶“你就叫悟空吧！”\n　　祖师叫孙悟空又拜见了各位师兄，并给悟空找了间空房住下。从此悟空跟着师兄学习生活常识，讲究经典，写字烧香，空时做些扫地挑水的活。\n　　很快七年过去了，一天，祖师讲道结束后，问悟空想学什么本领。孙悟空不管祖师讲什么求神拜佛、打坐修行，只要一听不能长生不老，就不愿意学，菩提\n######################\nOutput:"},
