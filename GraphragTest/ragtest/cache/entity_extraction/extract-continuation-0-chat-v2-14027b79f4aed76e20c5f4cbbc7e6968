The runway had just been completed and was covered with peach baskets to prevent aircraft from landing until it was opened. LT Feightner was told to ignore the baskets and land on the new runway. As a result, LT Feightner's F7U became the first aircraft to land on the new runway for O'Hare.\n\nCommercial passenger flights started in 1955 and by the following year O'Hare was served by American, BOAC, Braniff, Capital, Delta, Eastern, North Central, Pan Am, TWA and United, along with freight airlines Riddle and Slick.  O'Hare also opened a $1 million \"Skymotive\" terminal for corporate aircraft in 1955, the first of its kind. \n\nGrowth was slow at first. By 1957 Chicago had invested over $25 million in O'Hare, but Midway remained the world's busiest airport and airlines were reluctant to relocate all of their services to O'Hare until better highway access and other capital improvements were completed.  The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 10 weekday departures on United, 9 on American, 6 on Capital, 3 Eastern, 3 TWA, 2 Delta, 2 North Central, and 1 Braniff. Also three weekly Pan Am and one weekly BOAC (Air France and Lufthansa were at Midway). O'Hare's first dedicated international terminal opened in August 1958. By April 1959 the airport had expanded to 7200 acre with new hangars, terminals, parking and other facilities. The expressway link to downtown Chicago, then known as the Northwest Expressway, was completed in 1960.\n\nGround was broken for the main terminal complex (of which Terminals 2 and 3 remain today) on April 1, 1959.  The complex, designed by C. F. Murphy and Associates, opened on January 1, 1962. \n\nAll fixed-wing scheduled airline service in Chicago moved from Midway to O'Hare by July 1962. President John F. Kennedy attended a dedication ceremony in 1963. After Kennedy was assassinated later that year, the section of Interstate 90 between downtown Chicago and O'Hare was renamed the Kennedy Expressway. The arrival of Midway's former traffic quickly made O'Hare the world's busiest airport, serving 10 million passengers annually. Within two years that number would double, with more people passing through O'Hare in 12 months than Ellis Island had processed in its entire existence. In late 1972, Chicago city officials reached an agreement with airlines to shift some services back to Midway in order to ease the overcrowding at O'Hare.  Despite this, O'Hare remained the world's busiest airport until 1998.  In the late 1960s Midway was nearly abandoned; it enjoyed a revival after startup carrier Midway Airlines began low-cost service there in 1979–80. \n\nPre-deregulation service\n\nAmerican Airlines, United Airlines and Trans World Airlines had many routes to the West Coast, Northeast and Midwest. TWA flew to Europe nonstop from O'Hare starting in 1958.    Northwest Orient Airlines flew to the Northeast, Pacific Northwest, Florida and Hawaii, as well as service through Alaska to Japan and the Far East.  Their 747 to Tokyo was O'Hare's first nonstop to Asia, in 1977. Delta Air Lines served the Southeast and Midwest. \n\nDuring this era, international flights (other than Canada) used Concourses B and C in Terminal 1. Braniff, Eastern, Northwest, Continental and Piedmont used Concourse D in Terminal 2. United was the main tenant in Concourses E and F of Terminal 2, with Ozark also using gates in Concourse F. In Terminal 3, Concourse G served TWA and Air Canada, and Concourses H and K served American, Delta and North Central (later merged into Republic Airlines).  Concourse A was, at one time, a satellite terminal for commuter airlines at the west end of the terminal complex. \n\nPost-deregulation developments\n\nIn the 1980s, after deregulation, TWA replaced Chicago with St. Louis as its main mid-continent hub.  Although TWA had one of the largest Chicago operations during the late 1970s, its operation was losing $25 million a year under intense competition from United and American. TWA attempted to compete with an all-coach service to the West Coast at the lowest prices in the market, but American and United eventually matched TWA's fares during the recession of 1979–81, and TWA pulled the service. In 1982, TWA swapped three of its Chicago gates for five of American's St. Louis gates, setting the stage for TWA's transition to St. Louis. \n\nNorthwest likewise shifted to a Minneapolis and Detroit-centered network by the early 1990s following its acquisition of Republic Airlines in 1986.  On January 17, 1980, the airport's weather station became the official point for Chicago's weather observations and records by the National Weather Service. \n\nUnited and American both established nationwide hubs at the airport in the 1980s, which continue to operate today. United developed a new US$500 million Terminal 1 (\"The Terminal of the Future\" or \"Terminal of Tomorrow\"), which was designed by Helmut Jahn and A. Epstein and Sons,  with Turner Construction as the construction manager,  and Thornton Tomasetti serving as the structural engineer.  It was built between 1985 and 1987 on the site of the old international terminal. Ground was broken for the new terminal complex in March 1985. The terminal opened with 13 gates on June\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>O'HARE<|>GEO<|>O'Hare is an airport in Chicago, Illinois, known for being the first to land an aircraft on a new runway and for its subsequent growth and development as a major aviation hub>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LT FEIGHTNER<|>PERSON<|>LT Feightner was the pilot who landed the first aircraft on the new runway at O'Hare>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMERICAN AIRLINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>American Airlines is one of the airlines that served O'Hare and moved all its services from Midway to O'Hare>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOAC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BOAC, later known as British Airways, was one of the airlines serving O'Hare in its early years>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRANIFF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Braniff International Airways was an airline that operated from O'Hare>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CAPITAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Capital Airlines was an early carrier at O'Hare>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DELTA AIR LINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Delta Air Lines served O'Hare and expanded its routes over time>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EASTERN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Eastern Air Lines was another early airline at O'Hare>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH CENTRAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>North Central Airlines was a regional airline that later merged into Republic Airlines and served O'Hare>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PAN AM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pan American World Airways, known as Pan Am, was a major international airline that served O'Hare>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TWA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Trans World Airlines was an airline with a significant presence at O'Hare, flying nonstop to Europe and later shifting its hub>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNITED AIRLINES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>United Airlines was a key player at O'Hare, establishing a nationwide hub and developing new terminals>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIDDLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Riddle Airlines was a freight airline at O'Hare>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLICK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Slick Airways was another freight airline operating from O'Hare>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C.
