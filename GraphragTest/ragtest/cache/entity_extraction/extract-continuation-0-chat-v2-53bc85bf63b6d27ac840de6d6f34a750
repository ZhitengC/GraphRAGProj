The University of Alaska has attempted to combat this by offering partial four-year scholarships to the top 10% of Alaska high school graduates, via the Alaska Scholars Program. \n\nPublic health and public safety\n\nThe Alaska State Troopers are Alaska's statewide police force. They have a long and storied history, but were not an official organization until 1941. Before the force was officially organized, law enforcement in Alaska was handled by various federal agencies. Larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on \"Public Safety Officers\" who have police training but do not carry firearms. In much of the state, the troopers serve as the only police force available. In addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law, wildlife Troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations. Due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the Troopers' duties, they employ a wide variety of land, air, and water patrol vehicles.\n\nMany rural communities in Alaska are considered \"dry,\" having outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages.  Suicide rates for rural residents are higher than urban. \n\nDomestic abuse and other violent crimes are also at high levels in the state; this is in part linked to alcohol abuse.  Alaska has the highest rate of sexual assault in the nation, especially in rural areas. The average age of sexually assaulted victims is 16 years old. In four out of five cases, the suspects were relatives, friends or acquaintances. \n\nCulture\n\nSome of Alaska's popular annual events are the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race that starts in Anchorage and ends in Nome, World Ice Art Championships in Fairbanks, the Blueberry Festival and Alaska Hummingbird Festival in Ketchikan, the Sitka Whale Fest, and the Stikine River Garnet Fest in Wrangell. The Stikine River attracts the largest springtime concentration of American bald eagles in the world.\n\nThe Alaska Native Heritage Center celebrates the rich heritage of Alaska's 11 cultural groups. Their purpose is to encourage cross-cultural exchanges among all people and enhance self-esteem among Native people. The Alaska Native Arts Foundation promotes and markets Native art from all regions and cultures in the State, using the internet. \n\nMusic\n\nInfluences on music in Alaska include the traditional music of Alaska Natives as well as folk music brought by later immigrants from Russia and Europe. Prominent musicians from Alaska include singer Jewel, traditional Aleut flautist Mary Youngblood, folk singer-songwriter Libby Roderick, Christian music singer/songwriter Lincoln Brewster, metal/post hardcore band 36 Crazyfists and the groups Pamyua and Portugal. The Man.\n\nThere are many established music festivals in Alaska, including the Alaska Folk Festival, the Fairbanks Summer Arts Festival, the [http://anchoragefolkfestival.org/ Anchorage Folk Festival], the Athabascan Old-Time Fiddling Festival, the Sitka Jazz Festival, and the Sitka Summer Music Festival. The most prominent orchestra in Alaska is the Anchorage Symphony Orchestra, though the Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra and Juneau Symphony are also notable. The Anchorage Opera is currently the state's only professional opera company, though there are several volunteer and semi-professional organizations in the state as well.\n\nThe official state song of Alaska is \"Alaska's Flag\", which was adopted in 1955; it celebrates the flag of Alaska.\n\nAlaska in film and on television\n\nAlaska's first independent picture entirely made in Alaska was The Chechahcos, produced by Alaskan businessman Austin E. Lathrop and filmed in and around Anchorage. Released in 1924 by the Alaska Moving Picture Corporation, it was the only film the company made.\n\nOne of the most prominent movies filmed in Alaska is MGM's Eskimo/Mala The Magnificent, starring Alaska Native Ray Mala. In 1932 an expedition set out from MGM's studios in Hollywood to Alaska to film what was then billed as \"The Biggest Picture Ever Made.\"  Upon arriving in Alaska, they set up \"Camp Hollywood\" in Northwest Alaska, where they lived during the duration of the filming. Louis B. Mayer spared no expense in spite of the remote location, going so far as to hire the chef from the Hotel Roosevelt in Hollywood to prepare meals.\n\nWhen Eskimo premiered at the Astor Theatre in New York City, the studio received the largest amount of feedback in its history to that point. Eskimo was critically acclaimed and released worldwide; as a result, Mala became an international movie star. Eskimo won the first Oscar for Best Film Editing at the Academy Awards, and showcased and preserved aspects of Inupiat culture on film.\n\nThe 1983 Disney movie Never Cry Wolf was at least partially shot in Alaska. The 1991 film White Fang, based on Jack London's novel and starring Ethan Hawke, was filmed in and around Haines. Steven Seagal's 1994 On Deadly Ground, starring Michael Caine, was filmed in part at the Worthington Glacier near Valdez.  The 1999 John Sayles film Limbo, starring David Strathairn, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and Kris Kristofferson, was filmed in Juneau.\n\nThe psychological thriller Insomnia, starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams, was shot in Canada, but was set in Alaska. The 2007 film directed by Sean Penn, Into The Wild, was partially filmed and set in Alaska. The film, which is based on the novel of the same name, follows the adventures of Christopher McCandless, who died in a remote abandoned bus along the Stampede Trail west of Healy in 1992.\n\nMany films and television shows set in Alaska are not filmed there; for example, Northern Exposure, set in the fictional town of Cicely, Alaska, was filmed in Roslyn, Washington. The 2007 horror feature 30 Days of Night is\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "######\n(\"entity\"<|>VERDANTIS'S CENTRAL INSTITUTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Verdantis's Central Institution is an organization responsible for setting interest rates and making policy decisions for the country of Verdantis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARTIN SMITH<|>PERSON<|>Martin Smith is the chair of the Central Institution, responsible for leading the meetings and press conferences)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARKET STRATEGY COMMITTEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Market Strategy Committee is a part of the Central Institution that decides on the benchmark interest rate)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTRAL INSTITUTION<|>MARTIN SMITH<|>Martin Smith is the chair of the Central Institution, indicating a strong leadership relationship|>relationship_strength: 0.9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTRAL INSTITUTION<|>MARKET STRATEGY COMMITTEE<|>The Market Strategy Committee is a committee within the Central Institution, indicating a clear organizational relationship|>relationship_strength: 0.8)\n##\n##\n\nOutput:\n(\"entity\"<|>VERDANTIS'S CENTRAL INSTITUTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Verdantis's Central Institution is an organization responsible for setting interest rates and making policy decisions for the country of Verdantis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARTIN SMITH<|>PERSON<|>Martin Smith is the chair of the Central Institution, responsible for leading the meetings and press conferences)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARKET STRATEGY COMMITTEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Market Strategy Committee is a part of the Central Institution that decides on the benchmark interest rate)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTRAL INSTITUTION<|>MARTIN SMITH<|>Martin Smith is the chair of the Central Institution, indicating a strong leadership relationship|>relationship_strength: 0.9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CENTRAL INSTITUTION<|>MARKET STRATEGY COMMITTEE<|>The Market Strategy Committee is a committee within the Central Institution, indicating a clear organizational relationship|>relationship_strength: 0.8)\n##\n##\n\nOutput in English:\nThe identified entities are:\n1.
