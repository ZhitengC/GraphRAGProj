It was replaced by a temporary Terminal 4 built in 1984. The terminal was connected to Terminal 2 by a glass-enclosed hallway. It had a Y shaped concourse similar to Concourses H/K in Terminal 3. \n\nConcourse A (Terminal 1)\n\nOld Terminal 1 also had a satellite Concourse A that served commuter airlines. Among the airlines that used to operate from this terminal were Air France, El Al, Icelandair, Mexicana de Aviación, Pan Am and Sabena. \n\nConcourse D (Terminal 2)\n\nA Concourse D in Terminal 2 previously existed and served as the concourse for AirCal, Air Wisconsin, Braniff, Continental, Eastern, Frontier Airlines, Northwest Orient, People Express, Piedmont and United Express until it was demolished in 1988 to make room for the current Terminal 1 concourses. It consisted of 12 gates.\n\nTerminal 4\n\nDue to the construction of Terminal 1 for United, all international arrivals and some international departures were relocated to a temporary Terminal 4 from 1984 until 1993. Terminal 4 was located on the ground floor of the main parking garage; departing and arriving passengers were transported by bus to and from their aircraft.  The terminal served many international carriers during this time, but was inadequate both in terms of operating area and bus loading/unloading capacity. \n\nGround for the new US$618 million International Terminal was broken on July 11, 1990 with airline executives and government officials, led by Mayor Richard M. Daley and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner, in attendance.  The new Terminal 5, designed by Perkins and Will in conjunction with Heard & Associates and Consoer Townsend & Associates  partially opened on May 27, 1993 with its two lower levels completed to handle all international arrivals.  The rest of the terminal, including the departures level, opened on September 30, 1993.  The \"Terminal 5\" name was used for this new terminal in order to avoid confusion with the old Terminal 4.\n\nSince the opening of Terminal 5, Terminal 4 has been made into the airport's facility for regional transit buses, hotel shuttles, and other ground transportation; the Terminal 4 designation may be used again in the future as new terminals are developed. The CTA Blue Line was extended to the airport in 1984.\n\nAirlines and destinations\n\nPassenger\n\nNote: All international arrivals, except for arrivals from airports with U.S. customs preclearance, are serviced at Terminal 5, regardless of the listed departure terminal.\n\n United's check-in and baggage claim is located at Terminal 1 but uses Concourses E and F, which are part of Terminal 2.\n\nProspective flights\n \nAmerican Airlines is planning to restart operations to India from the U.S. However, it is not yet known which airline hub American will fly to nonstop from Delhi. AA had pulled out of the Delhi route in early 2012 after its parent company filed for bankruptcy. Currently, only Air India and United Airlines have direct flights between India and the U.S. \n\nThe Vice Chairman of Air Serbia said, they could offer flights to Chicago and Toronto from Belgrade in two to three years after it establishes itself in the U.S. market. Air Serbia launched a New York-JFK route on June 23, 2016. \n\nEthiopian Airlines is planning on expanding its U.S. long-haul network as it takes delivery of its new Airbus A350-900 and Boeing 787-8 aircraft. Ethiopian is looking at possible flights to Chicago and Houston from Addis Ababa after launching its new service to Newark, which could be launched in 2017. \n\nInterjet intends to expand to various cities in the United States  including Chicago.  The carrier currently flies to five destinations in the U.S. including Houston, Las Vegas, San Antonio, Miami, and New York. Oneworld has stated that it is interested in recruiting an airline from Mexico, preferably Interjet, to fill in the void left by Mexicana de Aviación. In 2014, several Oneworld airlines signed codeshare agreements with the Mexican carrier including American Airlines \n\nPhilippine Airlines announced a U.S. expansion plan in which its fifth mainland U.S. destination would most likely be Chicago. The carrier has previously served Chicago via Honolulu (once weekly) and San Francisco (twice weekly) on a Boeing 747-200 in the 1980s. PAL would operate on a nonstop flight from Manila on a Boeing 777-300ER or a new higher gross weight version of the A350-900.  \n\nQantas has expressed interest in servicing Chicago from Sydney with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, ever growing their Trans-Pacific joint venture agreement with Oneworld partner American Airlines. \n\nTAP Portugal intends to expand operations to 10 more U.S. destinations.  TAP announced new service to Boston and New York-JFK, beginning this summer. Both routes will be operated with new Airbus A330 aircraft, to be delivered in June.  As TAP takes delivery more long-haul aircraft they are considering adding flights to Washington and Chicago from their hub in Lisbon. \n\nCargo\n\nThere are two main cargo areas at O'Hare that have warehouse, build-up/tear-down and aircraft parking facilities. The Southwest Cargo Area, adjacent to Irving Park Road, accommodates over 80% of the airport's all-cargo flights, divided among 9 buildings in two tiers. The North Cargo Area, which is a modest conversion of the former military base (the 1943 Douglas plant area), also receives air freighters. It is adjacent to the northern\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4", "temperature": 0.95, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 0.7, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
