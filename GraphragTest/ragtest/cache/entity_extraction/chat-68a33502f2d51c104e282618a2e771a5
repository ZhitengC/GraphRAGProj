The Wall Street Journal called Donald Duck \"The Jerry Lewis of Germany\", a reference to American star Jerry Lewis' popularity in France.[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203771904574181722075062290.html \"Why Donald Duck Is the Jerry Lewis of Germany\"], Susan Bernofsky, Wall Street Journal, May 23, 2009 Donald's dialogue in German comics tends to be more sophisticated and philosophical, he \"quotes from German literature, speaks in grammatically complex sentences and is prone to philosophical musings, while the stories often take a more political tone than their American counterparts\", features especially associated with Erika Fuchs's popular German translations of the comics created by The Good Duck Artist Carl Barks. Christian Pfeiler – former president of D.O.N.A.L.D., a German acronym which stands for \"German Organization for Non-commercial Followers of Pure Donaldism\" – says Donald is popular in Germany because \"almost everyone can identify with him. He has strengths and weaknesses; he lacks polish but is also very cultured and well-read.\" It is through this everyman persona that Donald is able to voice philosophical truths about German society that appeal to both children and adults. Donald's writers and illustrators Carl Barks, Don Rosa and Ub Iwerks are well known in Germany, and have their own fan clubs.\n\nItaly\n\nDonald Duck (named Paolino Paperino) is also a very popular character in Italy, where new stories about him and Scrooge McDuck are hosted in the kids' weekly Topolino and the monthly Paperino. While Paperino is written by many authors, he still maintains several characteristics. He's mostly an everyman, but the fierce, harsh temper he has in the American comic appears to be diluted into a meek, weaker personality, prone to comical fits of rage that are mostly subdued by the realization of its impotence. His frustration at Gladstone's luck is comically enhanced: in the Italian comics Donald is chronically unlucky, unable to do or get anything right, with Gladstone taking advantage of his superiority or taking genuine pity of his unlucky cousin and trying several plans to grant him some better luck, always failing.\n\nHowever the constant search for an outlet to vent his frustration, led the Italian rendition of Donald Duck to seek his catharsis in several ways: in the sixties, vexed by Scrooge's antics and Gladstone luck, he reinvented himself as Paperinik, the Duck Avenger (as he came to be known outside Italy), an anti-hero at first, a self-assured, well adjusted, brilliant hero in later stories, no longer bound by the self-doubt and the mockery Donald is constantly subjected.[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c\nI+TL++706-AP], Paperinik il Diabolico Vendicatore, G. Martina Further along the years, he fashioned for himself the additional identies of QQ7, a bumbling secret agent protecting Scrooge's riches[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c\nI+TL++542-AP],Paperino Missione Bob Fingher, C. Chendi, G.B. Carpi and DoubleDuck, a more confident and suave secret agent, in the mold of James Bond, a more equilibrate mold of the heroic Duck Avenger and the tricky QQ7, often accompanied by the beautiful spy Kay K.[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c\nIC+TL+2735],Mi chiamo Duck, Doubleduck e sono un agente segreto!, A. Freccero Donald's \"secret identies\" are hosted in the main Topolino comics, but also in several themed comics, like the now defunct Paperinik, PKNA, PK^2 and the current Paperinik AppGrade, the latter hosting reprints and new stories as well.\n\nHaving several full lives to live doesn't hamper Donald's ability to live adventures on his own: he still lives adventures with his uncle Scrooge and his nephews (often acting as a reluctant bumbler, a ballast to the enthusiasm of his nephews and the wanderlust of his uncle), and he lived a starcrossed love story with a princess from another planet, Reginella.[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c\nI+TL++873-C],Paperino e l'avventura sottomarina, R. Cimino, G. Cavazzano Despite Reginella left a deep trace in Donald's heart, he's still depicted as extremely faithful to Daisy, with a small hiccup deriving by Daisy Duck having a secret identity on her own (Paperinika), with Paperinik and Paperinika, both unaware of their secret identities, cultivating a permanent status of belligerent tension.\n\nHe also keeps a cheerful rivalry with his neighbour Bum Bum Ghigno, more a bumbler and a nuisance than he is, but still a good person at heart.\n\nOddly enough, the Italian rendition of Donald Duck seldom, if ever, goes by his first name, having everyone, including his nephews, Daisy and Uncle Scrooge, address him as Paolino (his Italian surname). While the matter as never clarified, his choice fits the extreme loathing of his first name expressed by his mother Hortense.\n\nDisney theme parks\n\nDonald Duck has played a major role in many Disney theme parks over the years.
