Allwine once recounted something MacDonald had told him about voicing Mickey: \"The main piece of advice that Jim gave me about Mickey helped me keep things in perspective. He said, 'Just remember kid, you’re only filling in for the boss.' And that’s the way he treated doing Mickey for years and years. From Walt, and now from Jimmy.\"  Allwine would eventually marry Russi Taylor, the voice of Minnie Mouse since 1986. Les Perkins did the voice of Mickey in two TV specials \"Down and Out with Donald Duck\" and \"DTV Valentine\" in the mid-1980s. Peter Renaday voiced Mickey in the 1980s Disney albums Yankee Doodle Mickey and Mickey Mouse Splashdance.[http://bjbear71.com/Disney/DR6b.html A Disney Discography][http://www.startedbyamouse.com/features/CharacterRecords.shtml Character Records by Steve Burns - StartedByAMouse.com Features Section] He also provided his voice for The Talking Mickey Mouse toy in 1986.  \n\nBret Iwan, a former Hallmark greeting card artist, is the current voice of Mickey. His early recordings in 2009 included work for the Disney Cruise Line, Mickey toys, Theme Parks, and also the Disney on Ice: Celebrations! ice show.  His first video game voice-over of Mickey Mouse can be found on Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep, a video game for PlayStation Portable. He has also voiced the character in the next games for the Kingdom Hearts series. Iwan also does the vocal effects of Mickey in the games Epic Mickey and Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two as well as the remake of Castle of Illusion. Despite Iwan being Mickey's primary voice actor, the character's voice is provided by Chris Diamantopoulos in the 2013 animated series,  as the producers were looking for a retro voice to match the vintage look of the series. \n\nMickey in comics\n\nMickey first appeared in comics after he had appeared in 15 commercially successful animated shorts and was easily recognized by the public. Walt Disney was approached by King Features Syndicate with the offer to license Mickey and his supporting characters for use in a comic strip. Disney accepted and Mickey made his first comic strip appearance on January 13, 1930. The comical plot was credited to Disney himself, art to Ub Iwerks and inking to Win Smith. The first week or so of the strip featured a loose adaptation of \"Plane Crazy\". Minnie soon became the first addition to the cast. The strips first released between January 13, 1930, and March 31, 1930, has been occasionally reprinted in comic book form under the collective title \"Lost on a Desert Island\". Animation historian Jim Korkis notes \"After the eighteenth strip, Iwerks left and his inker, Win Smith, continued drawing the gag-a-day format...\" \n\nIn early 1930, after Iwerks' departure, Disney was at first content to continue scripting the Mickey Mouse comic strip, assigning the art to Win Smith. However, Disney's focus had always been in animation and Smith was soon assigned with the scripting as well. Smith was apparently discontent at the prospect of having to script, draw, and ink a series by himself as evidenced by his sudden resignation.\n\nDisney then searched for a replacement among the remaining staff of the Studio. He selected Floyd Gottfredson, a recently hired employee. At the time Gottfredson was reportedly eager to work in animation and somewhat reluctant to accept his new assignment. Disney had to assure him the assignment was only temporary and that he would eventually return to animation. Gottfredson accepted and ended up holding this \"temporary\" assignment from May 5, 1930, to November 15, 1975.\n\nWalt Disney's last script for the strip appeared May 17, 1930. Gottfredson's first task was to finish the storyline Disney had started on April 1, 1930. The storyline was completed on September 20, 1930, and later reprinted in comic book form as Mickey Mouse in Death Valley. This early adventure expanded the cast of the strip which to this point only included Mickey and Minnie. Among the characters who had their first comic strip appearances in this story were Clarabelle Cow, Horace Horsecollar and Black Pete as well as the debuts of corrupted lawyer Sylvester Shyster and Minnie's uncle Mortimer Mouse. The Death Valley narrative was followed by Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers, first printed between September 22 and December 26, 1930, which introduced Marcus Mouse and his wife as Minnie's parents.\n\nStarting with these two early comic strip stories, Mickey's versions in animation and comics are considered to have diverged from each other. While Disney and his cartoon shorts would continue to focus on comedy, the comic strip effectively combined comedy and adventure. This adventurous version of Mickey would continue to appear in comic strips and later comic books throughout the 20th and into the 21st century.\n\nFloyd Gottfredson left his mark with stories such as Mickey Mouse Joins the Foreign Legion (1936) and The Gleam (1942). He also created the Phantom Blot, Eega Beeva, Morty and Ferdie, Captain Churchmouse, and Butch. Besides Gottfredson artists for the strip over the years included Roman Arambula, Rick Hoover, Manuel Gonzales, Carson Van Osten, Jim Engel, Bill Wright, Ted Thwailes and Daan Jippes; writers included Ted Osborne, Merrill De Maris, Bill Walsh, Dick Shaw, Roy Williams, Del Connell, and Floyd Norman.\n\nThe next artist to\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WAYNE ALLWINE<|>PERSON<|>Wayne Allwine was the voice of Mickey Mouse until his death in 2009)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICKEY MOUSE<|>PERSON<|>Iconic Disney character whose voice was performed by Wayne Allwine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JIM MACDONALD<|>PERSON<|>A fellow voice actor who gave advice to Wayne Allwine about voicing Mickey Mouse)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSI TAYLOR<|>PERSON<|>Voice of Minnie Mouse since 1986 and wife of Wayne Allwine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LES PERKINS<|>PERSON<|>Voice actor who performed as Mickey Mouse in two TV specials)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETER RENADAY<|>PERSON<|>Voice actor who portrayed Mickey Mouse in Disney albums)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRET IWAN<|>PERSON<|>Current voice of Mickey Mouse and former Hallmark greeting card artist)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRIS DIAMANTOPOULOS<|>PERSON<|>Voice actor who provided a retro voice for Mickey in a 2013 animated series)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALT DISNEY<|>PERSON<|>Founder of Disney and the original licenser of Mickey Mouse for the comic strip)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UB IWERKS<|>PERSON<|>Artist who contributed to the Mickey Mouse comic strip)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIN SMITH<|>PERSON<|>Artist and inker for the Mickey Mouse comic strip)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLOYD GOTTFREDSON<|>PERSON<|>Long-time artist and writer for the Mickey Mouse comic strip)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KING FEATURES SYNDICATE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Syndicate that offered to license Mickey Mouse for the comic strip)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISNEY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Company that produces entertainment products, including Mickey Mouse)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICKEY MOUSE IN DEATH VALLEY<|>EVENT<|>A storyline in the Mickey Mouse comic strip that expanded the cast of characters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MR.
