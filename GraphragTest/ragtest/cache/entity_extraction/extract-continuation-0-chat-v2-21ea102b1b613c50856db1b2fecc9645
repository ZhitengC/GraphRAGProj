These series have various draws of 28, 32, 48 and 56 for singles and 16 and 24 for doubles. It is mandatory for leading players to enter at least four 500 events, including at least one after the US Open.\n\nChallenger Tour and Futures tournaments\n\nThe Challenger Tour for men is the lowest level of tournament administered by the ATP. It is composed of about 150 events and, as a result, features a more diverse range of countries hosting events.  The majority of players use the Challenger Series at the beginning of their career to work their way up the rankings. Andre Agassi, between winning Grand Slam tournaments, plummeted to World No. 141 and used Challenger Series events for match experience and to progress back up the rankings.  The Challenger Series offers prize funds of between US$25,000 and US$150,000.\n\nBelow the Challenger Tour are the Futures tournaments, events on the ITF Men's Circuit. These tournaments also contribute towards a player's ATP rankings points. Futures Tournaments offer prize funds of between US$10,000 and US$15,000.  Approximately 530 Futures Tournaments are played each year.\n\nWomen's tournament structure\n\nPremier events\n\nPremier events for women form the most prestigious level of events on the Women's Tennis Association Tour after the Grand Slam tournaments. These events offer the largest rewards in terms of points and prize money. Within the Premier category are Premier Mandatory, Premier 5, and Premier tournaments. The Premier events were introduced in 2009 replacing the previous Tier I and II tournament categories. Currently four tournaments are Premier Mandatory, five tournaments are Premier 5, and twelve tournaments are Premier. The first tiering system in women's tennis was introduced in 1988. At the time of its creation, only two tournaments, the Lipton International Players Championships in Florida and the German Open in Berlin, comprised the Tier I category.\n\nInternational events\n\nInternational tournaments are the second main tier of the WTA tour and consist of 31 tournaments, with a prize money for every event at U.S.$220,000, except for the year-ending Commonwealth Bank Tournament of Champions in Bali, which has prize money of U.S.$600,000.\n\nPlayers\n\nProfessional players\n\nProfessional tennis players enjoy the same relative perks as most top sports personalities: clothing, equipment and endorsements. Like players of other individual sports such as golf, they are not salaried, but must play and finish highly in tournaments to obtain money.\n\nIn recent years, some controversy has surrounded the involuntary or deliberate noise caused by players' grunting.\n\nGrand Slam tournament winners\n\nThe following players have won at least five singles titles at Grand Slam tournaments:\n\n;Female\n* Margaret Court (24)\n* Serena Williams (22)\n* Steffi Graf (22)\n* Helen Wills Moody (19)\n* Chris Evert (18)\n* Martina Navratilova (18)\n* Billie Jean King (12)\n* Maureen Connolly Brinker (9)\n* Monica Seles (9)\n* Molla Bjurstedt Mallory (8)\n* Suzanne Lenglen (8)\n* Dorothea Lambert Chambers (7)\n* Maria Bueno (7)\n* Evonne Goolagong Cawley (7)\n* Venus Williams (7)\n* Justine Henin (7)\n* Blanche Bingley Hillyard (6)\n* Doris Hart (6)\n* Margaret Osborne duPont (6)\n* Nancye Wynne Bolton (6)\n* Louise Brough Clapp (6)\n* Lottie Dod (5)\n* Charlotte Cooper Sterry (5)\n* Daphne Akhurst Cozens (5)\n* Helen Jacobs (5)\n* Alice Marble (5)\n* Pauline Betz Addie (5)\n* Althea Gibson (5)\n* Martina Hingis (5)\n* Maria Sharapova (5)\n\n;Male\n* Roger Federer (17)\n* Pete Sampras (14)\n* Rafael Nadal (14)\n* Roy Emerson (12)\n* Novak Djokovic (12)\n* Rod Laver (11)\n* Björn Borg (11)\n* Bill Tilden (10)\n* Fred Perry (8)\n* Ken Rosewall (8)\n* Jimmy Connors (8)\n* Ivan Lendl (8)\n* Andre Agassi (8)\n* William Renshaw (7)\n* Richard Sears (7)\n* William Larned (7)\n* Henri Cochet (7)\n* René Lacoste (7)\n* John Newcombe (7)\n* John McEnroe (7)\n* Mats Wilander (7)\n* Lawrence Doherty (6)\n* Anthony Wilding (6)\n* Donald Budge (6)\n* Jack Crawford (6)\n* Boris Becker (6)\n* Stefan Edberg (6)\n* Frank Sedgman (5)\n* Tony Trabert (5)\n\nGreatest male players\n\nA frequent topic of discussion among tennis fans and commentators is who was the greatest male singles player of all time. By a large margin, an Associated Press poll in 1950 named Bill Tilden as the greatest player of the first half of the 20th century.  From 1920 to 1930, Tilden won singles titles at Wimbledon three times and the U.S. Championships seven times. In 1938, however, Donald Budge became the first person to win all four major singles titles during the same calendar year, the Grand Slam, and won six consecutive major titles in 1937 and 1938. Tilden called Budge \"the finest player 365 days a year that ever lived.\"  And in his 1979 autobiography,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHAMPIONSHIPS<|>EVENT<|>A high-stakes tennis tournament series offering significant prize money and various draws for both singles and doubles)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHALLENGER TOUR<|>EVENT<|>The Challenger Tour is a lower-level tournament series administered by the ATP, featuring about 150 events and used by players to improve their rankings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUTURES TOURNAMENTS<|>EVENT<|>Futures tournaments are entry-level events on the ITF Men's Circuit that contribute to ATP rankings points and offer moderate prize funds)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOMEN'S TENNIS ASSOCIATION TOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The WTA Tour is the organizing body for women's professional tennis, hosting various tiers of tournaments including the Premier events)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PREMIER EVENTS<|>EVENT<|>The Premier events are"}]}
