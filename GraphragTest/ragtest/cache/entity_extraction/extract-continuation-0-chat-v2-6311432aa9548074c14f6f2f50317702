In his view, the Milky Way is celestial. This idea would be influential later in the Islamic world.\n\nThe Persian astronomer Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī (973–1048) proposed that the Milky Way is \"a collection of countless fragments of the nature of nebulous stars\". The Andalusian astronomer Avempace ( 1138) proposed the Milky Way to be made up of many stars but appears to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction in Earth's atmosphere, citing his observation of a conjunction of Jupiter and Mars in 1106 or 1107 as evidence. Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292–1350) proposed that the Milky Way is \"a myriad of tiny stars packed together in the sphere of the fixed stars\" and that these stars are larger than planets.\n\nAccording to Jamil Ragep, the Persian astronomer Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī (1201–1274) in his Tadhkira writes:\n\"The Milky Way, i.e. the Galaxy, is made up of a very large number of small, tightly clustered stars, which, on account of their concentration and smallness, seem to be cloudy patches. Because of this, it was likened to milk in color.\"\n\nActual proof of the Milky Way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study the Milky Way and discovered that it is composed of a huge number of faint stars.Galileo Galilei, Sidereus Nuncius (Venice, (Italy):  Thomas Baglioni, 1610), [https://archive.org/stream/Sidereusnuncius00Gali#page/n37/mode/2up pages 15 and 16.]\nEnglish translation:  Galileo Galilei with Edward Stafford Carlos, trans., The Sidereal Messenger (London, England:  Rivingtons, 1880), [https://archive.org/stream/siderealmessenge80gali#page/42/mode/2up/ pages 42 and 43.] In a treatise in 1755, Immanuel Kant, drawing on earlier work by Thomas Wright,Thomas Wright, An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe … (London, England:  H. Chapelle, 1750).\n*  [https://books.google.com/books?id80VZAAAAcAAJ&pg\nPA57#vonepage&q&f\nfalse On page 57], Wright stated that despite their mutual gravitational attraction, the stars in the constellations don't collide because they are in orbit, so centrifugal force keeps them separated:  \" … centrifugal force, which not only preserves them in their orbits, but prevents them from rushing all together, by the common universal law of gravity, … \"\n*  [https://books.google.com/books?id80VZAAAAcAAJ&pg\nPA48#vonepage&q&f\nfalse On page 48], Wright stated that the form of the Milky Way is a ring:  \" … the stars are not infinitely dispersed and distributed in a promiscuous manner throughout all the mundane space, without order or design, …  this phænomenon [is] no other than a certain effect arising from the observer's situation, …  To a spectator placed in an indefinite space, … it [i.e. the Milky Way (Via Lactea)] [is] a vast ring of stars … \"\n*  [https://books.google.com/books?id80VZAAAAcAAJ&pg\nPA65#vonepage&q&f\nfalse On page 65], Wright speculated that the central body of the Milky Way, around which the rest of the galaxy revolves, might not be visible to us:  \" ... the central body A, being supposed as incognitum [i.e. an unknown], without [i.e. outside of] the finite view; ... \"\n*  [https://books.google.com/books?id80VZAAAAcAAJ&pg\nPA73#vonepage&q&f\nfalse On page 73], Wright called the Milky Way the Vortex Magnus (the great whirlpool) and estimated its diameter to be 8.64×1012 miles (13.9×1012 km).\n*  [https://books.google.com/books?id80VZAAAAcAAJ&pg\nPA33#vonepage&q&f\nfalse On page 33], Wright speculated that there are a vast number of inhabited planets in the galaxy:  \" … ; therefore we may justly suppose, that so many radiant bodies [i.e. stars] were not created barely to enlighten an infinite void, but to … display an infinite shapeless universe, crowded with myriads of glorious worlds, all variously revolving round them; and … with an inconceivable variety of beings and states, animate … \" speculated (correctly) that the Milky Way might be a rotating body of a huge number of stars, held together by gravitational forces akin to the Solar System but on much larger scales.  The resulting disk of stars would be seen as a band on the sky from our perspective inside the disk. Kant also conjectured that some of the nebulae visible in the night sky might be separate \"galaxies\" themselves, similar to our own. Kant referred to both the Milky Way and the \"extragalactic nebulae\" as \"island universes\", a term still current up to the 1930s.
