The wedding was celebrated in grand style on 22 July 1515, and has been described by some historians as the First Congress of Vienna due to its significant implications for Europe's political landscape. All the children were still minors, so the wedding was formally completed in 1521. Vladislaus died on 13 March 1516, and Maximilian died on 12 January 1519, but his designs were ultimately successful: on Louis's death in 1526, Maximilian's grandson Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor became the King of Bohemia.\n\nThe Habsburg dynasty achieved the position of a true world power by the time of Charles V, for the first and only time in their history—the \"World Emperor\" and his \"empire on which the sun never sets\".\n\nDivision of the house: Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs\n\nAfter the assignment, on 21 April 1521, of the Austrian lands to Ferdinand I by his brother Emperor Charles V (also King Charles I of Spain) (1516–1556), the dynasty split into the junior branch of the Austrian Habsburgs and the senior branch of the Spanish Habsburgs. The Austrian Habsburgs held the title of Holy Roman Emperor after Charles' death in 1558, as well as the Habsburg Hereditary Lands and the Kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary.\n\nThe senior Spanish branch ruled over Spain, its Italian possessions and its colonial empire, the Netherlands, and, for a time (1580–1640), Portugal. Hungary was partly under Habsburg rule from 1526. For 150 years most of the country was occupied by the Ottoman Turks but these territories were re-conquered in 1683–1699.\n\nIn the secret Oñate treaty, the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs settled their mutual claims. The Spanish Habsburgs died out in 1700 (prompting the War of the Spanish Succession), as did the last male of the Austrian Habsburg line in 1740 (prompting the War of the Austrian Succession), and finally the last female of the Habsburg male line in 1780.\n\nExtinction of the Spanish Habsburgs\n\nThe Habsburgs sought to consolidate their power by the frequent use of consanguineous marriages. They were said to have a proverb that 'The best spouse for a Habsburg is another Habsburg.' This resulted in a cumulatively deleterious effect on their gene pool. Marriages between first cousins, or between uncle and niece, were commonplace in the family. A study of 3,000 family members over 16 generations by the University of Santiago de Compostela suggests that inbreeding directly led to their extinction.  The gene pool eventually became so small that the last of the Spanish line Charles II, who was severely disabled from birth, perhaps by genetic disorders, possessed a genome comparable to that of a child born to a brother and sister, as did his father, probably because of \"remote inbreeding\".  \n\nExtinction of the Austrian Habsburgs\n\nThe Austrian branch became extinct in the male line in 1740 with the death of Charles VI and in the female line in 1780 with the death of his daughter Maria Theresa; it was succeeded by the Vaudemont branch of the House of Lorraine in the person of her son Joseph II. The new successor house styled itself formally as House of Habsburg-Lorraine (German: Habsburg-Lothringen), although it was often referred to as simply the House of Habsburg. The heiress of the last Austrian Habsburgs Maria Theresa had married Francis Stephan, Duke of Lorraine  (both of them were great-grandchildren of Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand III, but from different empresses). Their descendants carried on the Habsburg tradition from Vienna under the dynastic name Habsburg-Lorraine, although technically a new ruling house came into existence in the Austrian territories, the House of Lorraine (see Dukes of Lorraine family tree). It is thought that extensive intra-family marriages within both lines contributed to their extinctions.\n\nHabsburg-Lorraine\n\nOn 6 August 1806 the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved under the French Emperor Napoleon I's reorganization of Germany. However, in anticipation of the loss of his title of Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II declared himself hereditary Emperor of Austria (as Francis I) on 11 August 1804, three months after Napoleon had declared himself Emperor of the French on 18 May 1804.\n\nEmperor Francis I of Austria used the official full list of titles: \"We, Francis the First, by the grace of God Emperor of Austria; King of Jerusalem, Hungary, Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Galicia and Lodomeria; Archduke of Austria; Duke of Lorraine, Salzburg, Würzburg, Franconia, Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola; Grand Duke of Cracow; Grand Prince of Transylvania; Margrave of Moravia; Duke of Sandomir, Masovia, Lublin, Upper and Lower Silesia, Auschwitz and Zator, Teschen, and Friule; Prince of Berchtesgaden and Mergentheim; Princely Count of Habsburg\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHARLES V<|>PERSON<|>Charles V inherited multiple kingdoms and laid the foundation for the Austria-Hungary empire)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CASTILE<|>GEO<|>One of the kingdoms inherited by Charles V)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARAGON<|>GEO<|>Another kingdom inherited by Charles V, which included colonies in the New World)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTHERN ITALY<|>GEO<|>Part of Charles V's inheritance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRIA<|>GEO<|>Part of Charles V's inheritance and where the Austria-Hungary empire was based)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOW COUNTRIES<|>GEO<|>Part of Charles V's inheritance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOUIS<|>PERSON<|>Son of Vladislaus II, who participated in a double wedding to secure the Habsburg dynasty's power)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARY<|>PERSON<|>Granddaughter of Maximilian, who participated in a double wedding with Louis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARCHDUKE FERDINAND<|>PERSON<|>Brother of Mary, who participated in a double wedding with Vladislaus' daughter)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANNA<|>PERSON<|>Daughter of Vladislaus II, who participated in a double wedding with Archduke Ferdinand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRST CONGRESS OF VIENNA<|>EVENT<|>Historical event where a double wedding took place, significant for Europe's political landscape)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VLADISLAUS II<|>PERSON<|>King of Hungary who died in 1516)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAXIMILIAN<|>PERSON<|>Grandfather of Mary, who laid the groundwork for the Habsburg dynasty's power)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FERDINAND I<|>PERSON<|>Maximilian's grandson who became Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HABSBURG DYNASTY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A dynasty that achieved world power status under Charles V)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPANISH HABSBURGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The senior branch of the Habsburg dynasty that ruled over Spain and its possessions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRIAN HABSBURGS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The junior branch of the Habsburg dynasty that ruled over Austrian lands)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Entity that included various kingdoms and was led by the Habsburgs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION<|>EVENT<|>Conflict that occurred after the extinction of the Spanish Habsburgs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WAR OF THE AUSTRIAN SUCCESSION<|>EVENT<|>Conflict that occurred after the extinction of the Austrian Habsburgs)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHARLES V<|>CASTILE<|>Charles V inherited the kingdom of Castile<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHARLES V<|>ARAGON<|>Charles V inherited the kingdom of Aragon<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHARLES V<|>SOUTHERN ITALY<|>Charles V inherited Southern Italy<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHARLES V<|>AUSTRIA<|>Charles V inherited Austria<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHARLES V<|>LOW COUNTRIES<|>Charles V inherited the Low Countries<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOUIS<|>MARY<|>Louis and Mary participated in a double wedding<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARCHDUKE FERDINAND<|>ANNA<|>Archduke Ferdinand and Anna participated in a double wedding<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOUIS<|>VLADISLAUS II<|>Louis is the son of Vladislaus II<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARY<|>MAXIMILIAN<|>Mary is the granddaughter of Maximilian<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FERDINAND I<|>MAXIMILIAN<|>Ferdinand I is the grandson of Maximilian<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HABSBURG DYNASTY<|>CHARLES V<|>Charles V was a member of the Habsburg Dynasty<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPANISH HABSBURGS<|>CHARLES V<|>Charles V was part of the Spanish Habsburgs<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUSTRIAN HABSBURGS<|>FERDINAND I<|>Ferdinand I was part of the Austrian Habsburgs<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE<|>FERDINAND I<|>Ferdinand I was the Holy Roman Emperor<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION<|>SPANISH HABSBURGS<|>The War of the Spanish Succession occurred after the Spanish Habsburgs' extinction<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WAR OF THE AUSTRIAN SUCCESSION<|>AUSTRIAN HABSBURGS<|>The War of the Austrian Succession occurred after the Austrian Habsburgs' extinction<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
