By the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549 Charles V combined the Netherlands into one administrative unit, to be inherited by his son Philip II.  Charles effectively united the Netherlands as one entity.  The Habsburgs controlled the 17 Provinces of the Netherlands until the Dutch Revolt in the second half of the 16th century, when they lost the seven northern Protestant provinces.  They held onto the southern Catholic part (roughly modern Belgium and Luxembourg) as the Spanish and Austrian Netherlands until they were conquered by French Revolutionary armies in 1795.  The one exception to this was the period of (1601–1621), when shortly before Philip II died on 13 September 1598, he renounced his rights to the Netherlands in favor of his daughter Isabella and her fiancé, Archduke Albert of Austria, a younger son of Emperor Maximilian II.  The territories reverted to Spain on the death of Albert in 1621, as the couple had no surviving offspring, and Isabella acted as regent-governor until her death in 1633:\n\n*the Archdukes Albert and Isabella, 1601-1621  \n\nKing of England\n\n*Philip II of Spain (Jure uxoris King, with Mary I of England 1554–1558)\n\nSpanish Habsburgs: Kings of Spain, Kings of Portugal (1581–1640) \n\nThe Habsburg Kingdom(s) of Spain were more a personal union of possessions of the Habsburg king and dynast, who was King of Castile, Leon, Aragon, Valencia, sometime of Portugal, Naples and Sicily, Duke of Milan, and Lord of the Americas, as well as Duke of Brabant, Count of Flanders and Holland, Duke of Luxemburg (i.e. all the Habsburg Netherlands). A listing of a number of the titles can be seen here.  The dynast (head of the Spanish Habsburgs, i.e. the King, showed this wide range of claims in his arms.  There are many more variants of these arms in the Habsburg Armory, Spanish Section as well as coat of arms of the King of Spain, coat of arms of Spain, coat of arms of the Prince of Asturias, and coats of arms of Spanish Monarchs in Italy.  The Spanish Habsburgs also kept up the Burgundian court tradition of the dynast being known by a \"nickname\" (e.g. the Bold, the Prudent, the Bewitched).   In Spain they were known as the \"\"Casa de Austria\", and illegitimate sons were known as \"de Austria\" (see Don Juan de Austria and Don Juan José de Austria).\n\n*Philip I of Castile the Handsome, second son of Maximilian I, founded the Spanish Habsburgs in 1496 by marrying Joanna the Mad, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella. Philip died in 1506, leaving the thrones of Castile and Aragon to be inherited and united into the throne of Spain by his son: \n*Charles I 1516–1556, aka Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor; divided the House into Austrian and Spanish lines The meanings of his arms are analyzed here.  \n*Philip II the Prudent 1556–1598, also Philip I of Portugal 1581–1598 and Philip I of England with his wife Mary I of England 1554–1558. The meanings of his arms are analyzed here. . \n*Philip III the Pious, also Philip II of Portugal 1598–1621 \n*Philip IV the Great 1621–1665, also Philip III of Portugal 1621–1640 \n*Charles II the Bewitched ( \"El Hechizado\") 1665–1700 \n\nThe War of the Spanish Succession took place after the extinction of the Spanish Habsburg line, to determine the inheritance of Charles II.\n\nAustrian Habsburgs: Holy Roman Emperors, Kings of Hungary and Bohemia, Archdukes of Austria \n\nThe main junior line of the house ruled the Duchy of Austria, as well as the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Kingdom of Hungary.  The dynasty however was split up again in 1564 among the children of deceased Emperor Ferdinand I of Habsburg. The Inner Austrian line founded by Archduke Charles II prevailed again, when his son and successor as regent of Inner Austria (i.e. the Duchy of Styria, the Duchy of Carniola with March of Istria, the Duchy of Carinthia, the Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca, and the Imperial City of Trieste, ruled from Graz) Ferdinand II in 1619 became Archduke of Austria and Holy Roman Emperor as well as King of Bohemia and Hungary in 1620. The Further Austrian/Tyrolean line of Ferdinand's brother Archduke Leopold V survived until the death of his son Sigismund Francis in 1665, whereafter their territories ultimately returned to common control with the other Austrian Habsburg lands. Inner Austrian stadtholders went on to rule until the days of Empress Maria Theresa in the 18th century.\n\n*Ferdinand I, emperor 1556–1564  (→Family Tree)\n*Maximilian II, emperor
