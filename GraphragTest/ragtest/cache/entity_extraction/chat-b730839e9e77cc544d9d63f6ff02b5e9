While the matter as never clarified, his choice fits the extreme loathing of his first name expressed by his mother Hortense.\n\nDisney theme parks\n\nDonald Duck has played a major role in many Disney theme parks over the years. He has actually been seen in more attractions and shows at the parks than Mickey Mouse has. He has appeared over the years in such attractions as Animagique, Mickey Mouse Revue, Mickey's PhilharMagic, Disneyland: The First 50 Magical Years, Gran Fiesta Tour Starring the Three Caballeros and the updated version of \"it's a small world\". He also is seen in the parks as a meet-and-greet character.\n\nOne long-ago-scrapped idea was also to have a bumper boat ride themed to Donald Duck.\n\nDonald in children's books\n\nDonald has been a frequent character in children's books beginning in 1935. Most of these books were published by Whitman Publishing, later called Western Publishing, or one of its subsidiaries.
