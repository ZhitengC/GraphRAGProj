Mickey's Toontown (Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland) is a themed land which is a recreation of Mickey's neighborhood. Buildings are built in a cartoon style and guests can visit Mickey or Minnie's houses, Donald Duck's boat, or Goofy's garage. This is a common place to meet the characters. \n\nMickey's PhilharMagic (Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland) is a 4D film which features Mickey in the familiar role of symphony conductor. At Main Street Cinema several of Mickey's short films are shown on a rotating basis; the sixth film is always Steamboat Willie. Mickey plays a central role in Fantasmic! (Disneyland Resort, Disney's Hollywood Studios) a live nighttime show which famously features Mickey in his role as the Sorcerer's Apprentice. Mickey was also a central character in the now defunct Mickey Mouse Revue (Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland) which was an indoor show featuring animatronic characters. Mickey's face currently graces the Mickey's Fun Wheel at Disney California Adventure Park, where a figure of him also stands on top of Silly Symphony Swings.\n\nIn addition to Mickey's overt presence in the parks, numerous images of him are also subtly included in sometimes unexpected places. This phenomenon is known as \"Hidden Mickey\", involving hidden images in Disney films, theme parks and merchandise.\n\nMickey in video games\n\nLike many popular characters, Mickey has starred in many video games, including Mickey Mousecapade on the Nintendo Entertainment System, Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse, Mickey's Ultimate Challenge, and Disney's Magical Quest on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse on the Mega Drive/Genesis, Mickey Mouse: Magic Wands! on the Game Boy, and many others. In the 2000s, the Disney's Magical Quest series were ported to the Game Boy Advance, while Mickey made his sixth generation era debut in Disney's Magical Mirror Starring Mickey Mouse, a Nintendo GameCube title aimed at younger audiences. Mickey plays a major role in the Kingdom Hearts series, as the king of Disney Castle and aide to the protagonist, Sora. King Mickey wields the Keyblade, a weapon in the form of a key that has the power to open any lock and combat darkness. Epic Mickey, featuring a darker version of the Disney universe, was released in 2010 for the Wii. The game is part of an effort by The Walt Disney Company to re-brand the Mickey Mouse character by moving away from his current squeaky clean image and reintroducing the mischievous side of his personality.\n\nAwards and honors\n\nMickey Mouse has received ten nominations for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. These are Mickey's Orphans (1931), Building a Building (1933), Brave Little Tailor (1938), The Pointer (1939), Lend a Paw (1941), Squatter's Rights (1946), Mickey and the Seal (1948), Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983), Runaway Brain (1995), and Get a Horse! (2013). Among these, Lend a Paw was the only film to actually win the award. Additionally, in 1932 Walt Disney received an honorary Academy Award in recognition of Mickey's creation and popularity.\n\nIn 1994, four of Mickey's cartoons were included in the book The 50 Greatest Cartoons which listed the greatest cartoons of all time as voted by members of the animation field. The films were The Band Concert (#3), Steamboat Willie (#13), Brave Little Tailor (#26), and Clock Cleaners (#27).\n\nOn November 18, 1978, in honor of his 50th anniversary, Mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The star is located on 6925 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nMelbourne (Australia) runs the annual Moomba festival street procession and appointed Mickey Mouse as their King of Moomba (1977). Although immensely popular with children, there was controversy with the appointment: some Melburnians wanted a 'home-grown' choice, e.g. Blinky Bill; when it was revealed that Patricia O'Carroll (from Disneyland's Disney on Parade show) was performing the mouse, Australian newspapers reported \"Mickey Mouse is really a girl!\"\n\nMickey was the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade on New Year's Day 2005. He was the first cartoon character to receive the honor, and only the second fictional character after Kermit the Frog in 1996.\n\nSocial impact\n\nUse in politics\n\nIn the United States, protest votes are often made in order to indicate dissatisfaction with the slate of candidates presented on a particular ballot, or to highlight the inadequacies of a particular voting procedure. Since most states' electoral systems do not provide for blank balloting or a choice of \"None of the Above\", most protest votes take the form of a clearly non-serious candidate's name entered as a write-in vote. Mickey Mouse is often selected for this purpose.  As an election supervisor in Georgia observed, \"If [Mickey Mouse] doesn’t get votes in our election, it’s a bad election.\"  The earliest known mention of Mickey Mouse as a write-in candidate dates back to the 1932 New York City mayoral elections. \n\nMickey Mouse's name has also been known to appear fraudulently on voter registration lists, most recently in the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election.  \n\nPejorative use of Mickey's name\n\n\"Mickey Mouse\" is a slang expression meaning small-time, amateurish or trivial. In the UK and Ireland, it also means poor quality or counterfeit. However, in parts of Australia it can mean excellent or very good (rhyming slang for \"grouse\").  Examples of the former two of the three usages include the\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MICKEY'S TOONTOWN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mickey's Toontown is a themed land in Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland that represents Mickey's neighborhood with cartoon-style buildings and interactive character experiences)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICKEY'S PHILHARMAGIC<|>EVENT<|>A 4D film that features Mickey conducting a symphony, shown in Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland, and Hong Kong Disneyland)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAIN STREET CINEMA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A cinema in Disneyland that shows Mickey's short films, including the classic Steamboat Willie)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FANTASMIC!<|>EVENT<|>A live nighttime show at Disneyland Resort and Disney's Hollywood Studios featuring Mickey as the Sorcerer's Apprentice)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICKEY MOUSE REVUE<|>EVENT<|>A defunct indoor show at Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland with animatronic characters, including Mickey)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISNEY CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE PARK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A theme park where Mickey's Fun Wheel and Silly Symphony Swings are attractions with Mickey's presence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIDDEN MICKEY<|>EVENT<|>A phenomenon where Mickey's images are subtly placed in unexpected areas of Disney films, theme parks, and merchandise)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICKEY MOUSECAPADE<|>EVENT<|>A video game featuring Mickey Mouse on the Nintendo Entertainment System)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KINGDOM HEARTS SERIES<|>EVENT<|>A series of video games where Mickey plays a major role as the king of Disney Castle and helper to the protagonist Sora)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EPIC MICKEY<|>EVENT<|>A video game released in 2010 for the Wii, featuring a darker version of Mickey and part of an effort to re-brand his character)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACADEMY AWARDS<|>EVENT<|>An event where Mickey Mouse has been nominated for the Best Animated Short Film award multiple times)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALT DISNEY<|>PERSON<|>The creator of Mickey Mouse who received an honorary Academy Award for his creation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME<|>GEO<|>Location where Mickey Mouse has a star in recognition of his 50th anniversary)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MOOMBA FESTIVAL<|>EVENT<|>An annual street procession in Melbourne, Australia, where Mickey Mouse was appointed as the King of Moomba in 1977)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOURNAMENT OF ROSES PARADE<|>EVENT<|>An event where Mickey served as the Grand Marshal on New Year's Day 2005)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MELBOURNE<|>GEO<|>City in Australia that runs the Moomba festival and had some controversy over Mickey Mouse being appointed as the King of Moomba)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICKEY'S TOONTOWN<|>DISNEYLAND<|>Mickey's Toontown is a themed land within Disneyland<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICKEY'S PHILHARMAGIC<|>DISNEYLAND<|>Mickey's PhilharMagic is a show in Disneyland<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICKEY MOUSE REVUE<|>TOKYO DISNEYLAND<|>The Mickey Mouse Revue was a show in Tokyo Disneyland<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICKEY'S FUN WHEEL<|>DISNEY CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE PARK<|>Mickey's Fun Wheel is an attraction in Disney California Adventure Park<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIDDEN MICKEY<|>DISNEY<|>Hidden Mickey is a feature of Disney's theme parks and merchandise<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICKEY MOUSECAPADE<|>MICKEY MOUSE<|>Mickey Mousecapade is a video game starring Mickey Mouse<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KINGDOM HEARTS SERIES<|>MICKEY MOUSE<|>Mickey plays a significant role in the Kingdom Hearts series<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EPIC MICKEY<|>MICKEY MOUSE<|>Epic Mickey is a game that is part of re-branding Mickey's character<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACADEMY AWARDS<|>MICKEY MOUSE<|>Mickey Mouse has been nominated for several Academy Awards<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WALT DISNEY<|>MICKEY MOUSE<|>Walt Disney is the creator of Mickey Mouse<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME<|>MICKEY MOUSE<|>Mickey has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MOOMBA FESTIVAL<|>MICKEY MOUSE<|>Mickey was chosen as the King of Moomba, causing some controversy<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOURNAMENT OF ROSES PARADE<|>MICKEY MOUSE<|>Mickey served as the Grand Marshal of the parade<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MELBOURNE<|>MOOMBA FESTIVAL<|>Melbourne hosts the Moomba festival where Mickey was appointed as the King<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
