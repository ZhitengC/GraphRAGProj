These have been given ownership over large tracts of land, which require stewardship.\n\nAlaska was formerly the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in one's home was completely legal under state law, though the federal law remains in force.\n\nThe state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the United States, with the Alaskan Independence Party. \n\nSix Republicans and four Democrats have served as governor of Alaska.  In addition, Republican Governor Wally Hickel was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after leaving the Republican party and briefly joining the Alaskan Independence Party ticket just long enough to be reelected. He subsequently officially rejoined the Republican party in 1994.\n\nAlaska's voter initiative making marijuana legal takes effect 24 February 2015, placing Alaska alongside Colorado and Washington as the three U.S. states where recreational marijuana is legal. The new law means people over age 21 can consume small amounts of pot — if they can find it. Commercial sales await implementation of Alaska Measure 2 (2014). \n\nTaxes\n\nTo finance state government operations, Alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies. This allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the United States.  It is one of five states with no state sales tax, one of seven states that do not levy an individual income tax, and one of the two states that has neither. The Department of Revenue Tax Division  reports regularly on the state's revenue sources. The Department also issues an annual summary of its operations, including new state laws that directly affect the tax division.\n\nWhile Alaska has no state sales tax, 89 municipalities collect a local sales tax, from 1.0–7.5%, typically 3–5%. Other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes, hotel, motel, and bed-and-breakfast 'bed' taxes, severance taxes, liquor and tobacco taxes, gaming (pull tabs) taxes, tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes. A part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees (such as petroleum, aviation motor fuel, telephone cooperative) is shared with municipalities in Alaska.\n\nFairbanks has one of the highest property taxes in the state as no sales or income taxes are assessed in the Fairbanks North Star Borough (FNSB). A sales tax for the FNSB has been voted on many times, but has yet to be approved, leading law makers to increase taxes dramatically on goods such as liquor and tobacco.\n\nIn 2014 the Tax Foundation ranked Alaska as having the fourth most \"business friendly\" tax policy, behind only Wyoming, South Dakota, and Nevada. \n\nFederal politics\n\nAlaska regularly supports Republicans in presidential elections and has done so since statehood. Republicans have won the state's electoral college votes in all but one election that it has participated in (1964). No state has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate fewer times. Alaska was carried by Democratic nominee Lyndon B. Johnson during his landslide election in 1964, while the 1960 and 1968 elections were close. Since 1972, however, Republicans have carried the state by large margins. In 2008, Republican John McCain defeated Democrat Barack Obama in Alaska, 59.49% to 37.83%. McCain's running mate was Sarah Palin, the state's governor and the first Alaskan on a major party ticket. Obama lost Alaska again in 2012, but he captured 40% of the state's vote in that election, making him the first Democrat to do so since 1968.\n\nThe Alaska Bush, central Juneau, midtown and downtown Anchorage, and the areas surrounding the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus and Ester have been strongholds of the Democratic Party. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the majority of Fairbanks (including North Pole and the military base), and South Anchorage typically have the strongest Republican showing. , well over half of all registered voters have chosen \"Non-Partisan\" or \"Undeclared\" as their affiliation,  despite recent attempts to close primaries to unaffiliated voters.\n\nBecause of its population relative to other U.S. states, Alaska has only one member in the U.S. House of Representatives. This seat is held by Republican Don Young, who was re-elected to his 21st consecutive term in 2012. Alaska's At-large congressional district is one of the largest parliamentary constituencies in the world.\n\nIn 2008, Governor Sarah Palin became the first Republican woman to run on a national ticket when she became John McCain's running mate.  She continued to be a prominent national figure even after resigning from the governor's job in July 2009. \n\nAlaska's United States Senators belong to Class 2 and Class 3.  In 2008, Democrat Mark Begich, mayor of Anchorage, defeated long-time Republican senator Ted Stevens. Stevens had been convicted on seven felony counts of failing to report gifts on Senate financial discloser forms one week before the election. The conviction was set aside in April 2009 after evidence of prosecutorial misconduct emerged.\n\nRepublican Frank Murkowski held the state's other senatorial position. After being elected governor in 2002, he resigned from the Senate and appointed his daughter, State Representative Lisa Murkowski as his successor. She won full six-year terms in 2004 and 2010.\n\nFile:Bill Walker inauguration speech.jpg|Bill Walker, Governor\nFile:Byron Mallott inaugural speech.jpg|Byron Mallott, Lieutenant Governor\nFile:Lisa Murkowski.jpg|Lisa Murkowski, senior United States Senator\nFile:Senator_Dan_Sullivan_official.jpg|Dan Sullivan, junior United States Senator\nFile:Don Young, official photo portrait, color, 2006.jpg|Don Young, at-large United States Representative\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALASKA<|>GEO<|>Alaska is a state in the United States known for its independence movement and unique tax policies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALASKAN INDEPENDENCE PARTY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Alaskan Independence Party is a political party in Alaska that advocates for the state's independence from the United States)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WALLY HICKEL<|>PERSON<|>Wally Hickel is a politician who served as the governor of Alaska and briefly joined the Alaskan Independence Party)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REPUBLICAN PARTY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Republican Party is one of the two major political parties in the United States, which has had a strong presence in Alaska)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEMOCRATIC PARTY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Democratic Party is one of the two major political parties in the United States, which also has a presence in Alaska)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE TAX DIVISION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Department of Revenue Tax Division is responsible for reporting on Alaska's revenue sources and issuing annual summaries of its operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAIRBANKS NORTH STAR BOROUGH (FNSB)<|>GEO<|>The Fairbanks North Star Borough is a borough in Alaska known for its high property taxes and lack of sales or income taxes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TAX FOUNDATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Tax Foundation is an organization that ranks states based on their tax policies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LYNDON B.
