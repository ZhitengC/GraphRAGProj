Under Maximilian, the possessions of the Habsburgs would be united again under one ruler, after he had re-conquered the Duchy of Austria after the death of Matthias Corvinus, who resided in Vienna and styled himself duke of Austria from 1485–1490.\n\nKing of the Romans and Holy Roman Emperors prior to the reunion of the Habsburg possessions\n\n*Rudolph I, emperor 1273–1291 (never crowned) \n*Albert I, emperor 1298–1308 (never crowned) \n*Albert II, emperor 1438–1439 (never crowned) -ancestor of Empress Catherine II of Russia \n*Frederick III, emperor 1440–1493 \n\nKings of Hungary and Bohemia prior to the reunion of the Habsburg possessions\n\n* Albert, king of Hungary and Bohemia (1437–1439) \n* Ladislaus V Posthumus, king of Hungary (1444–1457) and Bohemia (1453–1457) \n\nHoly Roman Emperors, Archdukes of Austria\n\nThe title Archduke of Austria, the one most famously associated with the Habsburgs, was invented in the Privilegium Maius, a 14th-century forgery initiated by Duke Rudolf IV of Austria. Originally, it was meant to denote the ruler of the (thus 'Arch')duchy of Austria, in an effort to put that ruler on par with the Prince-electors, as Austria had been passed over in the Golden Bull of 1356, when the electorships had been assigned. Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV refused to recognize the title. Ladislaus the Posthumous, Duke of Austria, who died in 1457, was never in his lifetime authorized to use it, and accordingly, not he nor anyone in his branch of the dynasty ever used the title.\n\nDuke Ernest the Iron and his descendants unilaterally assumed the title \"archduke\".  This title was only officially recognized in 1453 by his son, Emperor Frederick III, when the Habsburgs had (permanently) gained control of the office of the Holy Roman Emperor. Emperor Frederick III himself used just Duke of Austria, never Archduke, until his death in 1493.\n\nFrederick's son and heir, the future Emperor Maximilian I, started to use the title, but apparently only after the death of his wife Mary of Burgundy (died 1482) as the title never appears in documents of joint Maximilian and Mary rule in the Low Countries (where Maximilian is still titled Duke of Austria). The title appears first in documents of joint Maximilian and Philip (his under-age son) rule in the Low Countries. It only gained currency with Charles V and the descendants of his brother, the Emperor Ferdinand.\n\n*Maximilian I, emperor 1508–1519    \n*Charles V, emperor 1519–1556, his arms are explained in an article about them  \n\nTitular Dukes of Burgundy, Lords of the Netherlands \n\nThe reigning duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, was the chief political opponent of Maximilian's father Frederick III. Charles controlled not only Burgundy (both dukedom and county), but the wealthy and powerful Netherlands, the real center of his power.  Frederick was concerned about Burgundy's expansive tendencies on the western border of his Holy Roman Empire, and to forestall military conflict, he attempted to secure the marriage of Charles's only daughter, Mary of Burgundy, to his son Maximilian. After the Siege of Neuss (1474–75), he was successful. The wedding between Maximilian and Mary took place on the evening of 16 August 1477, after the death of Charles.Heinz-Dieter Heimann: Die Habsburger. Dynastie und Kaiserreiche.
