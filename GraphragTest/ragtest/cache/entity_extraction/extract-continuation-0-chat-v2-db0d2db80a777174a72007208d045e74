In 1938, however, Donald Budge became the first person to win all four major singles titles during the same calendar year, the Grand Slam, and won six consecutive major titles in 1937 and 1938. Tilden called Budge \"the finest player 365 days a year that ever lived.\"  And in his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer said that, based on consistent play, Budge was the greatest player ever.  Some observers, however, also felt that Kramer deserved consideration for the title. Kramer was among the few who dominated amateur and professional tennis during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Tony Trabert has said that of the players he saw before the start of the open era, Kramer was the best male champion. \n\nBy the latter half of the 1950s and 1960s, Budge and others had added Pancho Gonzales and Lew Hoad to the list of contenders. Budge reportedly believed that Gonzales was the greatest player ever.  Gonzales said about Hoad, \"When Lew's game was at its peak nobody could touch him. ... I think his game was the best game ever. Better than mine. He was capable of making more shots than anybody. His two volleys were great. His overhead was enormous. He had the most natural tennis mind with the most natural tennis physique.\" \n\nDuring the open era, first Rod Laver and then more recently Björn Borg and Pete Sampras were regarded by many of their contemporaries as among the greatest ever. Andre Agassi, the first of two male players in history to have achieved a Career Golden Slam in singles tennis (followed by Rafael Nadal), has been called the best service returner in the history of the game.    He is the first man to win slams on all modern surfaces (previous holders of all slams played in an era of grass and clay only), and is regarded by a number of critics and fellow players to be among the greatest players of all time.   \n\nRoger Federer is now considered by many observers to have the most \"complete\" game in modern tennis. He has won 17 grand slam titles and 6 world tour finals, the most for any male player. Many experts of tennis, former tennis players and his own tennis peers believe Federer is the greatest player in the history of the game.        Federer's biggest rival Rafael Nadal is regarded as the greatest competitor in tennis history by some former players and is regarded to have the potential to be the greatest of all time.   Nadal is regarded as the greatest clay court player of all time. \n\nGreatest female players\n\nAs with the men there are frequent discussions about who is the greatest female singles player of all time with Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova and Serena Williams being the three players most often nominated.\n\nIn March 2012 the TennisChannel published a combined list of the 100 greatest men and women tennis players of all time.  It ranked Steffi Graf as the greatest female player (in 3rd place overall), followed by Martina Navratilova (4th place) and Margaret Court (8th place). The rankings were determined by an international panel.\n\nSportwriter John Wertheim of Sports Illustrated stated in an article in July 2010 that Serena Williams is the greatest female tennis player ever with the argument that \"Head-to-head, on a neutral surface (i.e. hard courts), everyone at their best, I can't help feeling that she crushes the other legends.\".  In a reaction to this article Yahoo sports blog Busted Racket published a list of the top-10 women's tennis players of all time placing Martina Navratilova in first spot.  This top-10 list was similar to the one published in June 2008 by the Bleacher Report who also ranked Martina Navratilova as the top female player of all time. \n\nSteffi Graf is considered by some to be the greatest female player. Billie Jean King said in 1999, \"Steffi is definitely the greatest women's tennis player of all time.\" Martina Navratilova has included Graf on her list of great players. In December 1999, Graf was named the greatest female tennis player of the 20th century by a panel of experts assembled by the Associated Press.  Tennis writer Steve Flink, in his book The Greatest Tennis Matches of the Twentieth Century, named her as the best female player of the 20th century, directly followed by Martina Navratilova. \n\nTennis magazine selected Martina Navratilova as the greatest female tennis player for the years 1965 through 2005.   Tennis historian and journalist Bud Collins has called Navratilova \"arguably, the greatest player of all time.\" Billie Jean King said about Navratilova in 2006, \"She's the greatest singles, doubles and mixed doubles player who's ever lived.\" \n\nIn popular culture\n\n* David Foster Wallace, an amateur tennis player himself at Urbana High School in Illinois,  included tennis in many of his works of nonfiction and fiction including \"Tennis Player Michael Joyce's Professional Artistry as a Paradigm of Certain Stuff about Choice, Freedom, Discipline, Joy, Grotesquerie, and Human Completeness,\" the autobiographical piece \"Derivative Sport in Tornado Alley,\" and Infinite Jest, which is partially set at the fictional \"Enfield Tennis Academy\" in Massachusetts.\n* Japanese Manga series The Prince of Tennis revolves around the tennis prodigy Echizen Ryoma and tennis matches between rival schools. \n* The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) features Richie Tenenbaum\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TILDEN<|>PERSON<|>A tennis player who won multiple titles at Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships in the 1920s and 1930s)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD BUDGE<|>PERSON<|>The first person to win all four major singles titles in a calendar year, achieving the Grand Slam, and winner of six consecutive major titles)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JACK KRAMER<|>PERSON<|>A dominant tennis player in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and a proponent of considering Budge the greatest player ever)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TONY TRABERT<|>PERSON<|>A tennis player who regarded Kramer as the best male champion among players before the start of the open era)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PANCHO GONZALES<|>PERSON<|>A"}]}
