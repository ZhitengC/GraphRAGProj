In the year ended 31 March 1983, the pools generated £1.08 million out of a total of £1.46 million.  By 1990, this source of income had been overtaken by revenue from sponsorships and television rights. As of 1990, 75% of these central revenues were split equally between the 38 member clubs, with the remaining 25% allocated according to each club's position in the league ladder. During the 1970s and 1980s, the main terrestrial television companies (STV and BBC Scotland) produced shows (Scotsport and Sportscene respectively) containing highlights of league matches. The revenues from these broadcasts were relatively small, with the companies paying less than £1000 per match in the mid-1970s. BBC Radio Scotland had exclusive rights for live radio coverage of matches at this time,  with independent stations such as Radio Clyde providing coverage via score updates and analysis. \n\nThe first live television broadcast of a Scottish league match was not until April 1986. Earlier in the 1985–86 season, there had been no television coverage at all due to a dispute between the League and the broadcasters. The birth of satellite broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting (Sky TV) changed the situation significantly. As ITV had an exclusive contract for live coverage of games in the English league, the first match shown on Sky was a Scottish Premier Division match between Rangers and Dundee United in April 1991. A year later, the top division English clubs formed a breakaway Premier League, signing an exclusive television contract with Sky. Live Scottish Premier Division games were shown on STV during the 1990s, but the top division clubs formed the breakaway Scottish Premier League in 1998 and signed an exclusive broadcast contract with Sky.\n\nThis left the remaining Scottish Football League clubs without live coverage, although STV continued to show highlights of First Division games in their Football First show. Scots Gaelic channel BBC Alba provided coverage of Scottish Football League games, including the Challenge Cup, from its launch in 2008. Live coverage on English language channels returned to Scottish Football League games in the 2012–13 season, as Sky and ESPN agreed contracts to show Third Division matches involving Rangers. These arrangements secured revenues that had been under threat due to the financial collapse of Rangers.\n\nMember clubs\n\nOf the original SFL clubs, Celtic, Heart of Midlothian, St Mirren, Dumbarton and Rangers are the only clubs today playing in the successor Scottish Professional Football League. Every other club is either defunct or out of the League.\n\nPast winners\n\nWhen the Scottish Football League was established in 1890, all of the clubs played in just one division. In 1893 the Scottish Football League absorbed many clubs from the Scottish Football Alliance and had enough clubs to form another division. The existing division was renamed the First Division and the new division was called the Second Division. Nevertheless, promotion and relegation between the top two divisions was not automatic until 1921–22 when the Second Division was brought back after a hiatus provoked by World War I which affected only that division; hence some teams of the era winning the Second Division twice in a row before being promoted, and some Second Division winners being never promoted at all.\n\nA third tier of Scottish league football was first established in the 1923–24 season, but it only lasted for two full seasons due to financial difficulties. A third tier league (called Division C) was reintroduced in 1946–47. Division C, which also included reserve teams of higher division clubs, operated as a national competition for the first three seasons but thereafter it was split into two regional sections. During this period only full-strength clubs (not reserve teams) were promoted if they finished as champions. The two-division tier was abolished after the 1954–55 season.\n\nSince the 1975–76 season there has been a third tier, known as the Second Division. The top tier became the Premier Division and the second tier became known as the First Division. A fourth tier, known as the Third Division, was introduced in 1994. The last major change within the Scottish football league system was in 1998–99, when the Premier Division clubs broke away from the Scottish Football League to form the Scottish Premier League. The remaining Scottish Football League divisions continued as before.\n\nScottish Football League XI\n\nThe SFL was the organising body of the Scottish Football League XI, a select side which represented the SFL in matches against other leagues, including The Football League, the League of Ireland, the Irish league and the Italian league.  These matches began in 1892, soon after the foundation of the SFL. Before the Second World War, inter-league matches were only second in importance to Scotland international matches. After the war, however, the inter-league matches became less important as European club football was instituted and clubs withdrew players due to fixture congestion. The last inter-league match was played in 1980, while a Scottish Football League XI was last selected in 1990 for a match against Scotland, to mark the centenary of the SFL.\nAnswer these questions:\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SCOTTISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Scottish Football League is the former organizing body of Scottish football, which was established in 1890 and later became the Scottish Professional Football League)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CELTIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Celtic is one of the original SFL clubs still playing in the Scottish Professional Football League)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEART OF MIDLOTHIAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Heart of Midlothian is one of the original SFL clubs still playing in the Scottish Professional Football League)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ST MIRREN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>St Mirren is one of the original SFL clubs still playing in the Scottish Professional Football League)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUMBARTON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dumbarton is one of the original SFL clubs still playing in the Scottish Professional Football League)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RANGERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rangers is one of the original SFL clubs still playing in the Scottish Professional Football League)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOTTISH PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The successor to the Scottish Football League, which the original clubs now play in)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOTS SPORT<|>EVENT<|>\"Scotsport\" was a show on STV containing highlights of Scottish league matches)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPORTSCENE<|>EVENT<|>\"Sportscene\" was a show on BBC Scotland containing highlights of Scottish league matches)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BBC RADIO SCOTLAND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BBC Radio Scotland had exclusive rights for live radio coverage of Scottish league matches)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RADIO CLYDE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An independent station providing coverage of Scottish league matches via score updates and analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SKY TV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>British Sky Broadcasting, which changed the landscape of Scottish football broadcasting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ITV<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Had an exclusive contract for live coverage of English league games, leading to Sky showing Scottish Premier Division matches)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOTTISH PREMIER DIVISION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The top division of Scottish football, which later became the Scottish Premier League)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOTTISH PREMIER LEAGUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A breakaway league from the Scottish Football League, which signed an exclusive contract with Sky)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIRST DIVISION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The second tier of Scottish football during the existence of the Scottish Football League)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECOND DIVISION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The third tier of Scottish football, which has had various iterations and was later known as the Second Division)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THIRD DIVISION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The fourth tier of Scottish football, introduced in 1994)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOTTISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE XI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A select side representing the SFL in matches against other leagues)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOTTISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>SCOTTISH PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>The Scottish Football League became the Scottish Professional Football League<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CELTIC<|>SCOTTISH PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>Celtic is a member club of the Scottish Professional Football League<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEART OF MIDLOTHIAN<|>SCOTTISH PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>Heart of Midlothian is a member club of the Scottish Professional Football League<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ST MIRREN<|>SCOTTISH PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>St Mirren is a member club of the Scottish Professional Football League<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DUMBARTON<|>SCOTTISH PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>Dumbarton is a member club of the Scottish Professional Football League<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RANGERS<|>SCOTTISH PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>Rangers is a member club of the Scottish Professional Football League<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOTS SPORT<|>SCOTTISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>\"Scotsport\" showed highlights of SFL matches<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPORTSCENE<|>SCOTTISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>\"Sportscene\" showed highlights of SFL matches<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BBC RADIO SCOTLAND<|>SCOTTISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>BBC Radio Scotland covered live SFL matches<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RADIO CLYDE<|>SCOTTISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>Radio Clyde provided coverage of SFL matches<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SKY TV<|>SCOTTISH PREMIER DIVISION<|>Sky TV showed live Scottish Premier Division matches<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOTTISH PREMIER LEAGUE<|>SKY TV<|>The Scottish Premier League signed an exclusive broadcast contract with Sky<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOTTISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE XI<|>SCOTTISH FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>The SFL XI represented the SFL in inter-league matches<|>7)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
