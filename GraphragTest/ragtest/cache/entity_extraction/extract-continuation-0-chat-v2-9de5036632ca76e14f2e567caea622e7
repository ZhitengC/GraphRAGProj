In tournament play, the chair umpire announces the winner of the set and the overall score. The final score in sets is always read with the winning player's score first, e.g. \"6–2, 4–6, 6–0, 7–5\".\n\nMatch\n\nA match consists of a sequence of sets. The outcome is determined through a best of three or five sets system. Recreational players may agree to play any number of sets, depending upon time availability or stamina. On the professional circuit, men play best-of-five-set matches at all four Grand Slam tournaments, Davis Cup, and the final of the Olympic Games and best-of-three-set matches at all other tournaments, while women play best-of-three-set matches at all tournaments. The first player to win two sets in a best-of-three, or three sets in a best-of-five, wins the match.  Only in the final sets of matches at the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, the Olympic Games, Davis Cup (until 2015), and Fed Cup are tie-breaks not played. In these cases, sets are played indefinitely until one player has a two-game lead, leading to some remarkably long matches.\n\nIn tournament play, the chair umpire announces the end of the match with the well-known phrase \"Game, set, match\" followed by the winning person's or team's name.\n\nSpecial point terms\n\nGame point\n\nA game point occurs in tennis whenever the player who is in the lead in the game needs only one more point to win the game. The terminology is extended to sets (set point), matches (match point), and even championships (championship point). For example, if the player who is serving has a score of 40-love, the player has a triple game point (triple set point, etc.) as the player has three consecutive chances to win the game. Game points, set points, and match points are not part of official scoring and are not announced by the chair umpire in tournament play.\n\nBreak point\n\nA break point occurs if the receiver, not the server, has a chance to win the game with the next point. Break points are of particular importance because serving is generally considered advantageous, with servers being expected to win games in which they are serving. A receiver who has one (score of 30–40 or advantage), two (score of 15–40) or three (score of love-40) consecutive chances to win the game has break point, double break point or triple break point, respectively. If the receiver does, in fact, win their break point, the game is awarded to the receiver, and the receiver is said to have converted their break point. If the receiver fails to win their break point it is called a failure to convert. Winning break points, and thus the game, is also referred to as breaking serve, as the receiver has disrupted, or broken the natural advantage of the server. If in the following game the previous server also wins a break point it is referred to as breaking back. Except where tie-breaks apply, at least one break of serve is required to win a set.\n\nRule variations\n\n* No ad\nFrom 'No advantage'. Scoring method created by Jimmy Van Alen. The first player or doubles team to win four points wins the game, regardless of whether the player or team is ahead by two points. When the game score reaches three points each, the receiver chooses which side of the court (advantage court or deuce court) the service is to be delivered on the seventh and game-deciding point. Utilized by World Team Tennis professional competition, ATP tours, WTA tours, ITF Pro Doubles and ITF Junior Doubles.  \n\n* Pro set\nInstead of playing multiple sets, players may play one \"pro set\". A pro set is first to 8 (or 10) games by a margin of two games, instead of first to 6 games. A 12-point tie-break is usually played when the score is 8–8 (or 10–10). These are often played with no-ad scoring.\n\n* Match tie-break\nThis is sometimes played instead of a third set. A match tie-break (also called super tie-break) is played like a regular tie-break, but the winner must win ten points instead of seven. Match tie-breaks are used in the Hopman Cup, Grand Slams (excluding Wimbledon) and the Olympic Games for mixed doubles; on the ATP (since 2006), WTA (since 2007) and ITF (excluding four Grand Slam tournaments and the Davis Cup) tours for doubles and as a player's choice in USTA league play.\n\nAnother, however informal, tennis format is called Canadian doubles. This involves three players, with one person playing a doubles team. The single player gets to utilize the alleys normally reserved only for a doubles team. Conversely, the doubles team does not use the alleys when executing a shot. The scoring is the same as a regular game. This format is not sanctioned by any official body.\n\n\"Australian doubles\", another informal and unsanctioned form of tennis, is played with similar rules to the Canadian doubles style, only in this version, players rotate court position after each game. As such, each player plays doubles and singles over the course of a match, with the singles player always serving. Scoring styles vary, but one popular method is to assign a value of 2 points to each game, with the server taking both points if he or she holds serve and the doubles team each taking one if they break serve.\n\nWheelchair tennis can be played by able-bodied players as well as people who require a wheelchair for mobility. An extra bounce is permitted.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AUSTRALIAN OPEN<|>EVENT<|>One of the four Grand Slam tournaments where the final sets do not have tie-breaks>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRENCH OPEN<|>EVENT<|>One of the four Grand Slam tournaments where the final sets do not have tie-breaks>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIMBLEDON<|>EVENT<|>One of the four Grand Slam tournaments where the final sets do not have tie-breaks>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAVIS CUP<|>EVENT<|>A tournament where men play best-of-five-set matches, and until 2015, the final sets did not have tie-breaks>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FED CUP<|>EVENT<|>A tournament where the final sets do not have tie-breaks>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OLYMPIC GAMES<|>EVENT<|>"}]}
