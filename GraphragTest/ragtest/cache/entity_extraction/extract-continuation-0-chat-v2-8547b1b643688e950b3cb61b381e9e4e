Epstein and Sons,  with Turner Construction as the construction manager,  and Thornton Tomasetti serving as the structural engineer.  It was built between 1985 and 1987 on the site of the old international terminal. Ground was broken for the new terminal complex in March 1985. The terminal opened with 13 gates on June 15, 1987.  The terminal was officially dedicated on August 4, 1987 with Mayor Harold Washington in attendance at the dedication ceremony, and the ticketing and baggage claim areas, as well as 29 more gates, were opened.  Concourse D of Terminal 2 was demolished in order to make way for the rest of the terminal, which was completed in December 1988.  American renovated its existing facilities in Terminal 3 from 1987 to 1990. These renovations were designed by Kober/Belluschi Associates, Inc. and Welton Becket & Associates.  Delta maintained a Chicago hub for some time, and opened a new Concourse L, initially known as the \"Delta Flight Center\", designed by Perkins and Will and Milton Pate & Associates, in Terminal 3 in 1983, but ultimately closed its Chicago hub in the 1990s.\n\nTotal annual passenger volume at O'Hare reached 30 million in 1968, 40 million in 1976, 60 million in 1990 and 70 million in 1997.\n\nA $80 million renovation of Concourse G in Terminal 3 designed by Teng & Associates, Inc. began in the spring of 1999  and finished in the spring of 2001. The concourse was enlarged into a 144500 sqft facility with 25 remodeled gates. Six large \"sky vaults\", huge skylights atop V-shaped columns that bring natural light into a previously confined space, were constructed. A new 4138 sqft Admirals Club was also added to the concourse. \n\nDelta moved its operations from Terminal 3 to Terminal 2 in 2009 in order to align its operations with merger partner Northwest. Continental moved from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1 in 2010 prior to merging with United. \n\nIn 2013, the Chicago Department of Aviation appropriated a $19,500 two-year contract to use livestock, specifically goats, sheep, llamas, and burros, to assist with grounds maintenance. This plan was implemented due to difficulties in reaching certain areas on the runway property with traditional lawn mowing machines due to rocky or sloped terrain. About 25 animals were recruited chiefly to clear growing vegetation around the approximately 120 acre space around the runways. A secondary reason for the introduction of the animals, especially the llamas and burros, was to reduce interference from wildlife such as coyotes and birds that may come when smaller prey settle in unmaintained, grassy areas.\n\nUnited States Air Force use\n\nSee: O'Hare Air Reserve Station\nThe original Douglas Aircraft C-54 Skymaster transport manufacturing plant on the northeast side of the airport became a United States Air Force Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve facility after World War II. It was used by the United States Air Force from 1947 until 1999 as O'Hare Air Reserve Station, making the airport a joint civil-military airfield during this period.\n\nThe 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended the closure of O'Hare Air Reserve Station as proposed by the municipal government of the City of Chicago and the transfer of both the Illinois Air National Guard's 126th Air Refueling Wing (126 ARW) and its KC-135 aircraft, and the Air Force Reserve Command's 928th Airlift Wing (928 AW) and its C-130 aircraft to new facilities to be constructed at Scott AFB, Illinois. The 126 ARW moved from the former O'Hare Air Reserve Station to Scott AFB, Illinois in 1999 as recommended by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission's Report to Congress in conjunction with the closure of the Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard facilities at O'Hare. Instead of moving to Scott AFB, subsequent BRAC action directed that the 928 AW be inactivated and its C-130 aircraft reallocated to other Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units.\n\nFollowing the closure of the O'Hare Air Reserve Station, the former United States Air Force facilities were redeveloped for air cargo and general aviation. This was partly necessitated by the abrupt closure of Meigs Field in 2003, which diverted General Aviation in Chicago to O'Hare and Midway. Today, Signature Flight Support services private aircraft in this area.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nLocation\n\nMost of O'Hare Airport is in Cook County, but a section of the southwest part of the airport is in DuPage County. The airport is located within a section of the City of Chicago contiguously connected to the rest of the city via a narrow strip of land about 200 ft wide, running along Foster Avenue, from the Des Plaines River to the airport.   This land was annexed into the city limits in the 1950s to assure the massive tax revenues associated with the airport would go to the city. The strip is bounded on the north by Rosemont and the south by Schiller Park. \n\nRunways\n\nOn October 17, 2013 O'Hare opened Runway 10C-28C. The opening of this eighth runway marked the completion of the Phase II expansion project. O'Hare landings have been reconfigured to predominately use a triple arrival scheme utilizing three of the four parallel runways, with the fourth runway being used for takeoffs.\n\nBefore the opening\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TERMINAL 1<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Terminal 1, also known as \"The Terminal of the Future\" or \"Terminal of Tomorrow\", is a state-of-the-art terminal designed by Helmut Jahn and A.
