A new club entered the league, Meadowbank Thistle, but would eventually become Livingston in 1995. This three-divisional structure (of 38 clubs) continued until 1994.\n\nFour-division period and SPL split\n\nAfter a couple of decades, the league again reorganised, with four divisions of 10 clubs, as  Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Ross County were elected to round out the league. At the same time, the SFL adopted the system of three points for a win.  In 1998 the Premier Division clubs split from the league to form the Scottish Premier League (SPL). The remaining leagues, of ten clubs each, kept their names and the Premier Division was not reconstituted, leaving First, Second and Third Divisions. Part of the agreement was that the SPL would expand to 12 clubs in 2000. The SFL then took in two new members to replace the two clubs lost to the SPL. Highland League clubs Elgin City and Peterhead were admitted, increasing the total number of clubs in the Scottish football league system to 42.\n\nFrom 2005, the SFL determined a promotion and relegation place between each division according to playoffs between four clubs. The playoffs were contested between the ninth placed (second bottom) club in the higher division and the second, third and fourth placed clubs in the lower division. It was therefore possible for a team finishing fourth in the Second Division or Third Division to be promoted, rather than the clubs finishing immediately above them in the standings. It was also possible for the ninth placed club to retain their position in the higher division.\n\nIn March 2007, a self-conducted review found the league to be three times more expensive to run than equivalent leagues in England, with a report stating the league structure was \"outdated\". The report found that the Football Conference has four employees looking after 68 clubs, while the SFL had 14 people running leagues with just 30 clubs. \n\nMerger\n\nNo clubs were relegated from the bottom end of the Scottish Football League, although there were changes of membership due to clubs going out of business.     The Scottish Football Association were keen for a pyramid system to be instituted. SFL First Division clubs wanted to gain a greater share of the media revenue generated by the SPL. In 2013, both the SPL and SFL voted in favour of merging to form the new Scottish Professional Football League. The number of divisions and clubs in each division remained the same, but there were changes to the financial distribution model.\n\nCup competitions\n\nThe Scottish Football League organised two knock-out cup competitions: the Scottish League Cup and the Scottish Challenge Cup. The League Cup was established in 1946, succeeding the wartime Southern League Cup. Unlike the Scottish Cup, organised by the Scottish Football Association, the League Cup was only open to Scottish Football League clubs. Scottish Premier League clubs continued to participate in the League Cup after the top tier clubs broke away in 1998. Until the mid-1990s, the competition winner was eligible to participate in the UEFA Cup, but this was discontinued due to a loss of European places.\n\nThe Scottish Challenge Cup was instituted in 1990, to celebrate the League's centenary.  The Challenge Cup was only open to Scottish Football League clubs outside the top division of the Scottish football league system. From 2011, two Highland Football League clubs were allowed to participate each year in the Challenge Cup, to give a round number of 32 clubs participating. Both the League Cup and the Challenge Cup continued under the auspices of the Scottish Professional Football League.\n\nLeague sponsorship and media rights\n\nFrom 1985, the League accepted sponsorships for its main competition. Below is a list of sponsors and the League's name under their sponsorship:\n\n*1985–1988: Fine Fare (Fine Fare League)\n*1988–1992: B&Q (B&Q League)\n*1992–1994: No sponsor\n*1994–1998: Bell's whisky (Bell's League) \n*1998–1999: No sponsor\n*1999–2006: Bell's whisky (Bell's League) \n*2006–2007: No sponsor\n*2007–2013: Irn-Bru (Irn-Bru League)  \n\nThe League's cup competitions have had different sponsors, with the Scottish League Cup first attracting sponsorship in 1979.  The competition was revamped in 1984, adopting a straight knock-out format, when Skol Lager began its sponsorship.  The Co-operative Insurance company sponsored the League Cup for 12 seasons, until the 2010–11 competition.  It has since been sponsored by the Scottish Government, under the name of the Scottish Communities League Cup.  The Scottish Challenge Cup was created by League sponsor B&Q in 1990, but it was cancelled in 1998–99 due to a lack of sponsorship.  Since 2008, the Challenge Cup has attracted its own sponsor, with BBC Alba and Ramsdens providing support.\n\nBefore 1979, the major source of revenue to Scottish Football League clubs, apart from their attendances, was from the football pools. In the year ended 31 March 1983, the pools generated £1.08 million out of a total of £1.46 million.  By 1990, this source of income had been overtaken by revenue from sponsorships and television rights. As of 1990, 75% of these central revenues were split equally between the 38 member clubs, with the remaining 25% allocated according to each club's position in the league\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MEADOWBANK THISTLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Meadowbank Thistle was a club that later became Livingston in 1995)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIVINGSTON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Livingston is the new name of Meadowbank Thistle after a change in 1995)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INVERNESS CALEDONIAN THISTLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Inverness Caledonian Thistle is a club that was elected to the league during a reorganisation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROSS COUNTY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ross County is a club that was also elected to the league during a reorganisation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SFL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Scottish Football League (SFL) is the organizing body of Scottish football leagues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Scottish Premier League (SPL) was formed when Premier Division clubs split from the SFL in 1998)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELGIN CITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Elgin City is a club from the Highland League that was admitted to the SFL)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETERHEAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Peterhead is a club from the Highland League that was admitted to the SFL)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOTTISH FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Scottish Football Association was keen on instituting a pyramid system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOTTISH PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Formed by the merger of SPL and SFL in 2013, it changed the financial distribution model)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOTTISH LEAGUE CUP<|>EVENT<|>A knock-out cup competition established in 1946 for Scottish Football League clubs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCOTTISH CHALLENGE CUP<|>EVENT<|>Instituted in 1990 for Scottish Football League clubs outside the top division)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEADOWBANK THISTLE<|>LIVINGSTON<|>Meadowbank Thistle changed its name to Livingston in 1995<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SFL<|>SPL<|>The SPL was formed by a split from the SFL in 1998<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPL<|>SCOTTISH PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>The SPL merged with the SFL to form the SPFL in 2013<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SFL<|>SCOTTISH PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>The SFL merged with the SPL to form the SPFL in 2013<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELGIN CITY<|>PETERHEAD<|>Both clubs were admitted to the SFL from the Highland League<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOTTISH LEAGUE CUP<|>SFL<|>The Scottish League Cup is organised by the SFL<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOTTISH CHALLENGE CUP<|>SFL<|>The Scottish Challenge Cup was created by the SFL<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOTTISH LEAGUE CUP<|>SCOTTISH PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>The League Cup continued under the SPFL<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCOTTISH CHALLENGE CUP<|>SCOTTISH PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE<|>The Challenge Cup also continued under the SPFL<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
