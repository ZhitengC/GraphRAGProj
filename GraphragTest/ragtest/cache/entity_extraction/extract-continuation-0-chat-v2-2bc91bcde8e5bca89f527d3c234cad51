Many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of Alaska's 16 boroughs, which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states. However, unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states, the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. The area not part of any borough is referred to as the Unorganized Borough.\n\nThe Unorganized Borough has no government of its own, but the U.S. Census Bureau in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 census areas solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation. A recording district is a mechanism for administration of the public record in Alaska. The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a State Recorder. All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria, fee schedule, etc., for accepting documents into the public record.\n\nWhereas many U.S. states use a three-tiered system of decentralization—state/county/township—most of Alaska uses only two tiers—state/borough. Owing to the low population density, most of the land is located in the Unorganized Borough. As the name implies, it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government. In 2000, 57.71% of Alaska's area has this status, with 13.05% of the population.\n\nAnchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper and the communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird, and Indian. Fairbanks has a separate borough (the Fairbanks North Star Borough) and municipality (the City of Fairbanks).\n\nThe state's most populous city is Anchorage, home to 278,700 people in 2006, 225,744 of whom live in the urbanized area. The richest location in Alaska by per capita income is Halibut Cove ($89,895). Yakutat City, Sitka, Juneau, and Anchorage are the four largest cities in the U.S. by area.\n\nCities and census-designated places (by population)\n\nAs reflected in the 2010 United States Census, Alaska has a total of 355 incorporated cities and census-designated places (CDPs).  The tally of cities includes four unified municipalities, essentially the equivalent of a consolidated city–county.  The majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of Alaska known as \"The Bush\" and are unconnected to the contiguous North American road network.  The table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska, in population order.\n\nOf Alaska's 2010 Census population figure of 710,231, 20,429 people, or 2.88% of the population, did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place.  Approximately three-quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of Ketchikan, Kodiak, Palmer and Wasilla.  CDPs have not been established for these areas by the United States Census Bureau, except that seven CDPs were established for the Ketchikan-area neighborhoods in the 1980 Census (Clover Pass, Herring Cove, Ketchikan East, Mountain Point, North Tongass Highway, Pennock Island and Saxman East), but have not been used since.  The remaining population was scattered throughout Alaska, both within organized boroughs and in the Unorganized Borough, in largely remote areas.\n\nEducation\n\nThe Alaska Department of Education and Early Development administers many school districts in Alaska. In addition, the state operates a boarding school, Mt. Edgecumbe High School in Sitka, and provides partial funding for other boarding schools, including Nenana Student Living Center in Nenana and The Galena Interior Learning Academy in Galena. \n\nThere are more than a dozen colleges and universities in Alaska. Accredited universities in Alaska include the University of Alaska Anchorage, University of Alaska Fairbanks, University of Alaska Southeast, and Alaska Pacific University.  Alaska is the only state that has no institutions that are part of the NCAA Division I.\n\nThe Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development operates AVTEC, Alaska's Institute of Technology.  Campuses in Seward and Anchorage offer 1 week to 11-month training programs in areas as diverse as Information Technology, Welding, Nursing, and Mechanics.\n\nAlaska has had a problem with a \"brain drain\". Many of its young people, including most of the highest academic achievers, leave the state after high school graduation and do not return. , Alaska did not have a law school or medical school.  The University of Alaska has attempted to combat this by offering partial four-year scholarships to the top 10% of Alaska high school graduates, via the Alaska Scholars Program. \n\nPublic health and public safety\n\nThe Alaska State Troopers are Alaska's statewide police force. They have a long and storied history, but were not an official organization until 1941. Before the force was officially organized, law enforcement in Alaska was handled by various federal agencies. Larger towns usually have\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BILL WALKER<|>PERSON<|>Bill Walker is the Governor of Alaska)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BYRON MALLOTT<|>PERSON<|>Byron Mallott is the Lieutenant Governor of Alaska)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LISA MURKOWSKI<|>PERSON<|>Lisa Murkowski is a senior United States Senator from Alaska)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAN SULLIVAN<|>PERSON<|>Dan Sullivan is a junior United States Senator from Alaska)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DON YOUNG<|>PERSON<|>Don Young is the at-large United States Representative from Alaska)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALASKA<|>GEO<|>Alaska is a state in the United States, not divided into counties but into boroughs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNORGANIZED BOROUGH<|>GEO<|>The Unorganized Borough is the area in Alaska not part of any borough and is directly administered by the state government)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ANCHORAGE<|>GEO<|>Anchorage is a municipality in Alaska, formed by the merger of the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FAIRBANKS NORTH STAR BOROUGH<|>GEO<|>Fairbanks North Star Borough is a separate borough in Alaska, containing the City of Fairbanks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CITY OF FAIRBANKS<|>GEO<|>The City of Fairbanks is a municipality within the Fairbanks North Star Borough)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HALIBUT COVE<|>GEO<|>Halibut Cove in Alaska is known for having the highest per capita income in the state)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>YAKUTAT CITY<|>GEO<|>Yakutat City is one of the largest cities in Alaska by area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SITKA<|>GEO<|>Sitka is one of the largest cities in Alaska by area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUNEAU<|>GEO<|>Juneau is one of the largest cities in Alaska by area)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND EARLY DEVELOPMENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Alaska Department of Education and Early Development administers school districts and boarding schools in Alaska)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MT.
