These series have various draws of 28, 32, 48 and 56 for singles and 16 and 24 for doubles. It is mandatory for leading players to enter at least four 500 events, including at least one after the US Open.\n\nChallenger Tour and Futures tournaments\n\nThe Challenger Tour for men is the lowest level of tournament administered by the ATP. It is composed of about 150 events and, as a result, features a more diverse range of countries hosting events.  The majority of players use the Challenger Series at the beginning of their career to work their way up the rankings. Andre Agassi, between winning Grand Slam tournaments, plummeted to World No. 141 and used Challenger Series events for match experience and to progress back up the rankings.  The Challenger Series offers prize funds of between US$25,000 and US$150,000.\n\nBelow the Challenger Tour are the Futures tournaments, events on the ITF Men's Circuit. These tournaments also contribute towards a player's ATP rankings points. Futures Tournaments offer prize funds of between US$10,000 and US$15,000.  Approximately 530 Futures Tournaments are played each year.\n\nWomen's tournament structure\n\nPremier events\n\nPremier events for women form the most prestigious level of events on the Women's Tennis Association Tour after the Grand Slam tournaments. These events offer the largest rewards in terms of points and prize money. Within the Premier category are Premier Mandatory, Premier 5, and Premier tournaments. The Premier events were introduced in 2009 replacing the previous Tier I and II tournament categories. Currently four tournaments are Premier Mandatory, five tournaments are Premier 5, and twelve tournaments are Premier. The first tiering system in women's tennis was introduced in 1988. At the time of its creation, only two tournaments, the Lipton International Players Championships in Florida and the German Open in Berlin, comprised the Tier I category.\n\nInternational events\n\nInternational tournaments are the second main tier of the WTA tour and consist of 31 tournaments, with a prize money for every event at U.S.$220,000, except for the year-ending Commonwealth Bank Tournament of Champions in Bali, which has prize money of U.S.$600,000.\n\nPlayers\n\nProfessional players\n\nProfessional tennis players enjoy the same relative perks as most top sports personalities: clothing, equipment and endorsements. Like players of other individual sports such as golf, they are not salaried, but must play and finish highly in tournaments to obtain money.\n\nIn recent years, some controversy has surrounded the involuntary or deliberate noise caused by players' grunting.\n\nGrand Slam tournament winners\n\nThe following players have won at least five singles titles at Grand Slam tournaments:\n\n;Female\n* Margaret Court (24)\n* Serena Williams (22)\n* Steffi Graf (22)\n* Helen Wills Moody (19)\n* Chris Evert (18)\n* Martina Navratilova (18)\n* Billie Jean King (12)\n* Maureen Connolly Brinker (9)\n* Monica Seles (9)\n* Molla Bjurstedt Mallory (8)\n* Suzanne Lenglen (8)\n* Dorothea Lambert Chambers (7)\n* Maria Bueno (7)\n* Evonne Goolagong Cawley (7)\n* Venus Williams (7)\n* Justine Henin (7)\n* Blanche Bingley Hillyard (6)\n* Doris Hart (6)\n* Margaret Osborne duPont (6)\n* Nancye Wynne Bolton (6)\n* Louise Brough Clapp (6)\n* Lottie Dod (5)\n* Charlotte Cooper Sterry (5)\n* Daphne Akhurst Cozens (5)\n* Helen Jacobs (5)\n* Alice Marble (5)\n* Pauline Betz Addie (5)\n* Althea Gibson (5)\n* Martina Hingis (5)\n* Maria Sharapova (5)\n\n;Male\n* Roger Federer (17)\n* Pete Sampras (14)\n* Rafael Nadal (14)\n* Roy Emerson (12)\n* Novak Djokovic (12)\n* Rod Laver (11)\n* Björn Borg (11)\n* Bill Tilden (10)\n* Fred Perry (8)\n* Ken Rosewall (8)\n* Jimmy Connors (8)\n* Ivan Lendl (8)\n* Andre Agassi (8)\n* William Renshaw (7)\n* Richard Sears (7)\n* William Larned (7)\n* Henri Cochet (7)\n* René Lacoste (7)\n* John Newcombe (7)\n* John McEnroe (7)\n* Mats Wilander (7)\n* Lawrence Doherty (6)\n* Anthony Wilding (6)\n* Donald Budge (6)\n* Jack Crawford (6)\n* Boris Becker (6)\n* Stefan Edberg (6)\n* Frank Sedgman (5)\n* Tony Trabert (5)\n\nGreatest male players\n\nA frequent topic of discussion among tennis fans and commentators is who was the greatest male singles player of all time. By a large margin, an Associated Press poll in 1950 named Bill Tilden as the greatest player of the first half of the 20th century.  From 1920 to 1930, Tilden won singles titles at Wimbledon three times and the U.S. Championships seven times. In 1938, however, Donald Budge became the first person to win all four major singles titles during the same calendar year, the Grand Slam, and won six consecutive major titles in 1937 and 1938. Tilden called Budge \"the finest player 365 days a year that ever lived.\"  And in his 1979 autobiography,\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHAMPIONSHIPS<|>EVENT<|>A series of tennis tournaments offering significant prize money,强制 top players to participate in at least four 500 events>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHALLENGER TOUR<|>EVENT<|>The Challenger Tour is a lower-level tournament administered by the ATP, with about 150 events, used by players to improve their rankings>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FUTURES TOURNAMENTS<|>EVENT<|>Futures Tournaments are entry-level events on the ITF Men's Circuit, with prize funds between US$10,000 and US$15,000>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WOMEN'S TENNIS ASSOCIATION TOUR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Women's Tennis Association Tour hosts various levels of women's tennis events, including Premier events>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PREMIER EVENTS<|>EVENT<|>The most prestigious events on the WTA Tour after the Grand Slam tournaments, offering high points and prize money>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL EVENTS<|>EVENT<|>These are the second tier of the WTA tour, with 31 tournaments and consistent prize money, except for the year-end event in Bali>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROFESSIONAL TENNIS PLAYERS<|>PERSON<|>Professional tennis players who earn money through tournaments and endorsements, not through salaries>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GRAND SLAM TOURNAMENT<|>EVENT<|>The most prestigious tennis tournaments where players can win multiple titles>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARGARET COURT<|>PERSON<|>Margaret Court is a former tennis player with 24 Grand Slam singles titles>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SERENA WILLIAMS<|>PERSON<|>Serena Williams is a professional tennis player with 22 Grand Slam singles titles>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEFFI GRAF<|>PERSON<|>Steffi Graf is a former tennis player with 22 Grand Slam singles titles>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETE SAMPRAS<|>PERSON<|>Pete Sampras is a former tennis player with 14 Grand Slam singles titles>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RAFAEL NADAL<|>PERSON<|>Rafael Nadal is a professional tennis player with 14 Grand Slam singles titles>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROGER FEDERER<|>PERSON<|>Roger Federer is a professional tennis player with 17 Grand Slam singles titles>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHALLENGER TOUR<|>ATP<|>The Challenger Tour is administered by the ATP<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FUTURES TOURNAMENTS<|>ATP<|>Futures Tournaments contribute to ATP rankings points<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PREMIER EVENTS<|>WOMEN'S TENNIS ASSOCIATION TOUR<|>Premier events are part of the WTA Tour<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL EVENTS<|>WOMEN'S TENNIS ASSOCIATION TOUR<|>International events are part of the WTA Tour<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARGARET COURT<|>GRAND SLAM TOURNAMENT<|>Margaret Court won at least five singles titles at Grand Slam tournaments<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SERENA WILLIAMS<|>GRAND SLAM TOURNAMENT<|>Serena Williams won at least five singles titles at Grand Slam tournaments<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEFFI GRAF<|>GRAND SLAM TOURNAMENT<|>Steffi Graf won at least five singles titles at Grand Slam tournaments<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PETE SAMPRAS<|>GRAND SLAM TOURNAMENT<|>Pete Sampras won at least five singles titles at Grand Slam tournaments<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RAFAEL NADAL<|>GRAND SLAM TOURNAMENT<|>Rafael Nadal won at least five singles titles at Grand Slam tournaments<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROGER FEDERER<|>GRAND SLAM TOURNAMENT<|>Roger Federer won at least five singles titles at Grand Slam tournaments<|>10)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
