Donald's new rival girlfriends were Donna and Daisy Duck. Taliaferro also gave Donald his very own automobile, a 1934 Belchfire Runabout, in a 1938 story, which is often nicknamed by Donald's \"313\" car plate in the comic incarnation of Donald's world.\n\nDevelopments under Barks\n\nIn 1942, Western Publishing began creating original comic-book stories about Donald and other Disney characters. Bob Karp worked on the earliest of these, a story called \"Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold\". The new publisher meant new illustrators, however: Carl Barks and Jack Hannah. Barks would later repeat the treasure-hunting theme in many more stories.\n\nBarks soon took over the major development of the duck as both writer and illustrator. Under his pen, Donald became more adventurous, less temperamental and more eloquent. Pete was the only other major character from the Mickey Mouse comic strip to feature in Barks' new Donald Duck universe.\n\nBarks placed Donald in the city of Duckburg, which he populated with a host of supporting players, including Neighbour Jones (1944), Uncle Scrooge McDuck (1947), Gladstone Gander (1948), the Beagle Boys (1951), Gyro Gearloose (1952), April, May and June (1953), Flintheart Glomgold (1956), Magica de Spell (1961), and John D. Rockerduck (1961). Many of Taliaferro's characters made the move to Barks' world as well, including Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Barks placed Donald in both domestic and adventure scenarios, and Uncle Scrooge became one of his favorite characters to pair up with Donald. Scrooge's popularity grew, and by 1952, the character had a comic book of his own. At this point, Barks concentrated his major efforts on the Scrooge stories, and Donald's appearances became more focused on comedy or he was recast as Scrooge's reluctant helper, following his rich uncle around the globe.\n\nFurther developments\n\nDozens of writers continued to utilize Donald in their stories around the world.\n\nFor example, the Disney Studio artists, who made comics directly for the European market. Two of them, Dick Kinney (1917–1985) and Al Hubbard (1915–1984) created Donald's cousin Fethry Duck.\n\nThe American artists Vic Lockman and Tony Strobl (1915–1991), who were working directly for the American comic books, created Moby Duck. Strobl was one of the most productive Disney artists of all time, and drew many stories which Barks wrote and sketched after his retirement. In the 1990s and early 2000s, these scripts were re-drawn in a style closer to Barks' own by Dutch artist Daan Jippes.\n\nItalian publisher Mondadori created many of the stories that were published throughout Europe. They also introduced numerous new characters who are today well known in Europe. One example is Donald Duck's alter-ego, a superhero called Paperinik in Italian, created in 1969 by Guido Martina (1906–1991) and Giovan Battista Carpi (1927–1999).\n\nGiorgio Cavazzano and Carlo Chendi created Umperio Bogarto, a detective whose name is an obvious parody on Humphrey Bogart. They also created O.K Quack, an extraterrestrial Duck who landed on earth in a spaceship in the shape of a coin. He however lost his spaceship, and befriended Scrooge, and now is allowed to search through his moneybin time after time, looking for his ship.\n\nRomano Scarpa (1927–2005), who was a very important and influential Italian Disney artist, created Brigitta McBridge, a female Duck who is madly in love with Scrooge. Her affections are never answered by him, though, but she keeps trying. Scarpa also came up with Dickie Duck, the granddaughter of Glittering Goldie (Scrooge's possible love-interest from his days in the Klondike) and Kildare Coot, a nephew of Grandma Duck.\n\nItalian artist Corrado Mastantuono created Bum Bum Ghigno, a cynical, grumpy and not too good looking Duck who teams up with Donald and Gyro a lot.\n\nThe American artist William Van Horn also introduced a new character: Rumpus McFowl, an old and rather corpulent Duck with a giant appetite and laziness, who is first said to be a cousin of Scrooge. Only later, Scrooge reveals to his nephews Rumpus is actually his half-brother. Later, Rumpus also finds out.\n\nWorking for the Danish editor Egmont, artist Daniel Branca (1951–2005) and script-writers Paul Halas and Charlie Martin created Sonny Seagull, an orphan who befriends Huey, Dewey and Louie, and his rival, Mr. Phelps.\n\nOne of the most productive Duck-artist used to be Victor Arriagada Rios, (deceased 2012) better known under the name Vicar. He had his own studio where he and his assistants drew the stories sent in by Egmont. With writer/editors Stefan and Unn Printz-Påhlson, Vicar created the character Oona, a prehistoric duck princess who traveled to modern Duckburg by using Gyro's time-machine. She stayed, and is still seen in occasional modern stories.\n\nThe best-known and most popular Duck-artist of this time is American Don Rosa. He started doing Disney comics in 1987 for the American publisher Gladstone. He later\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>GUS GOOSE<|>PERSON<|>Gus Goose is a character, a cousin of Donald Duck)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELVIRA COOT<|>PERSON<|>Elvira Coot is a character, the grandmother of Donald Duck)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONNA DUCK<|>PERSON<|>Donna Duck is a character and one of Donald's rivals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DAISY DUCK<|>PERSON<|>Daisy Duck is a character and one of Donald's girlfriends)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DONALD DUCK<|>PERSON<|>Donald Duck is the main character, a Disney icon with many stories and relationships)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BELCHFIRE RUNABOUT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Belchfire Runabout is a car owned by Donald Duck in the comics)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WESTERN PUBLISHING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Western Publishing is a company that began creating original comic-book stories about Donald Duck)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOB KARP<|>PERSON<|>Bob Karp is a writer who worked on early Donald Duck comic-book stories)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CARL BARKS<|>PERSON<|>Carl Barks was an illustrator and writer who significantly developed the Donald Duck universe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JACK HANNAH<|>PERSON<|>Jack Hannah was an illustrator who worked on Donald Duck stories)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PETE<|>PERSON<|>Pete is a character from the Mickey Mouse comic strip who also appears in Barks' Donald Duck universe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DUCKBURG<|>GEO<|>Duckburg is the city where many of the Donald Duck stories take place)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEIGHBOUR JONES<|>PERSON<|>Neighbour Jones is a supporting character in the Donald Duck universe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNCLE SCROOGE MCDUCK<|>PERSON<|>Uncle Scrooge McDuck is a key character in Donald Duck stories, known for his wealth)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLADSTONE GANDER<|>PERSON<|>Gladstone Gander is a character in the Donald Duck universe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEAGLE BOYS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Beagle Boys are a group of characters who are opponents of Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GYRO GEARLOOSE<|>PERSON<|>Gyro Gearloose is an inventor character in the Donald Duck universe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APRIL, MAY AND JUNE<|>PERSON<|>April, May, and June are characters in the Donald Duck universe)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FLINTHEART GLOMGOLD<|>PERSON<|>Flintheart Glomgold is a character in the Donald Duck universe, a rival of Uncle Scrooge)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAGICA DE SPELL<|>PERSON<|>Magica de Spell is a character in the Donald Duck universe, known for her magic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JOHN D.
