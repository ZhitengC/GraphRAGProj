{"result": "The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31 or M31, is a spiral galaxy and a major neighbor to the Milky Way, located approximately 2.5 million light-years from Earth. It is part of the Local Group and is similar in size and mass to the Milky Way, housing an estimated one trillion stars. This galaxy is approaching the Milky Way at a significant speed of 100 to 140 kilometers per second, and there is a potential for a future collision between the two, which could result in the formation of a larger galaxy. The Andromeda Galaxy has a history shaped by more recent mergers, which has implications for understanding the Milky Way's own past and potential future extensions. Additionally, the discovery of the extended disk of the Andromeda Galaxy has furthered our understanding of the Milky Way's possible extensions. It is also used as a reference point to offer a different perspective on the view of the Milky Way.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
