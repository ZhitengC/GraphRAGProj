{"result": "The Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy is a dwarf galaxy with a unique polar orbit around the Milky Way. As it moves through space, it leaves a distinct ribbon of galactic debris trailing behind it. Moreover, this galaxy is believed to have played a role in shaping the structure of the Milky Way's spiral arms, possibly through past collisions between the two galaxies.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
