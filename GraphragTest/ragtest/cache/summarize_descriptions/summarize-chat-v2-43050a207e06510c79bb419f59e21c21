{"result": "The Small Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, which is currently in the process of being accreted. It is one of the two galaxies, along with the Large Magellanic Cloud, that defines the limits of the Galactic Halo. Situated approximately 200,000 light-years from Earth, the Small Magellanic Cloud has a diameter of about 7,000 light-years and is visible from the southern hemisphere. Although less prominent than the Large Magellanic Cloud, it contains a variety of intriguing astronomical objects. Additionally, as it orbits the Milky Way, the Small Magellanic Cloud, together with the Large Magellanic Cloud, creates a vibration as it passes through the edges of the galaxy.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
