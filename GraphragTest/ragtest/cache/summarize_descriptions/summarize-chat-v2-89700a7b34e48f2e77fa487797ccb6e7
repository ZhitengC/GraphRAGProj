{"result": "EXOPLANETS are planets that orbit stars located outside of the Solar System. A substantial number of these planets are estimated to be similar in size to Earth and fall within the habitable zones of their respective stars, suggesting the potential for life. Furthermore, exoplanets may actually outnumber gas giants in the Milky Way, indicating a diverse range of planetary bodies beyond our solar neighborhood.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
