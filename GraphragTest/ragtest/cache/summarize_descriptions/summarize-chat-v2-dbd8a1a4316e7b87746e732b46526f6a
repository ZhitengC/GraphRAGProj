{"result": "Alaska is a state located in the northwest extremity of the Americas, and it is the largest state by area in the United States. It is renowned for its diverse religious communities, rich natural resources, fishing, natural gas, and oil industries. Alaska faced unique transportation and governance challenges, which have led to the development of a well-structured ferry system, railroad, and air services to navigate its terrain and climate. The state is not divided into counties like the rest of the U.S. but is instead divided into boroughs. Alaska is known for its independence movement and unique tax and constitutional approaches to funds, which contribute to its high cost of living. Despite its vast area, Alaska has a low population density and is one of the wealthiest states per capita. Additionally, it received nearly 2 million visitors in 2012-2013, showcasing its appeal to tourists and adventurers.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
