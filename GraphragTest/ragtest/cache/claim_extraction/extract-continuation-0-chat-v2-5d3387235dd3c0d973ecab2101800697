The nearest such planet may be 12 light-years away, according to scientists. Such Earth-sized planets may be more numerous than gas giants.  Besides exoplanets, \"exocomets\", comets beyond the Solar System, have also been detected and may be common in the Milky Way. \n\nFile:ESO - The Milky Way panorama (by).jpg|360-degree panorama view of the Milky Way (an assembled mosaic of photographs) by ESO. The galactic centre is in the middle of the view, with galactic north up.\n\nStructure\n\nThe Milky Way consists of a bar-shaped core region surrounded by a disk of gas, dust and stars. The gas, dust and stars are organized in roughly logarithmic spiral arm structures (see Spiral arms below). The mass distribution within the Milky Way closely resembles the type Sbc in the Hubble classification, which represents spiral galaxies with relatively loosely wound arms. Astronomers first began to suspect that the Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy, rather than an ordinary spiral galaxy, in the 1990s. Their suspicions were confirmed by the Spitzer Space Telescope observations in 2005 that showed the Milky Way's central bar to be larger than previously thought.\n\nGalactic quadrants\n\nA galactic quadrant, or quadrant of the Milky Way, refers to one of four circular sectors in the division of the Milky Way. In actual astronomical practice, the delineation of the galactic quadrants is based upon the galactic coordinate system, which places the Sun as the origin of the mapping system. \n\nQuadrants are described using ordinals—for example, \"1st galactic quadrant\", \"second galactic quadrant\", or \"third quadrant of the Milky Way\". Viewing from the north galactic pole with 0 degrees (°) as the ray that runs starting from the Sun and through the Galactic Center, the quadrants are as follows:\n* 1st galactic quadrant – 0° ≤ longitude (ℓ) ≤ 90° \n* 2nd galactic quadrant – 90° ≤ ℓ ≤ 180°\n* 3rd galactic quadrant – 180° ≤ ℓ ≤ 270°\n* 4th galactic quadrant – 270° ≤ ℓ ≤ 360° (0°)\n\nGalactic Center\n\nThe Sun is 26000 - from the Galactic Center. This value is estimated using geometric-based methods or by measuring selected astronomical objects that serve as standard candles, with different techniques yielding various values within this approximate range. In the inner few kpc (around 10,000 light-years radius) is a dense concentration of mostly old stars in a roughly spheroidal shape called the bulge. It has been proposed that the Milky Way lacks a bulge formed due to a collision and merger between previous galaxies and that instead has a pseudobulge formed by its central bar.\n\nThe Galactic Center is marked by an intense radio source named Sagittarius A* (pronounced Sagittarius A-star). The motion of material around the center indicates that Sagittarius A* harbors a massive, compact object. This concentration of mass is best explained as a supermassive black hole (SMBH) with an estimated mass of 4.1–4.5 million times the mass of the Sun. The rate of accretion of the SMBH is consistent with an inactive galactic nucleus, being estimated at around   y−1. Observations indicate that there are SMBH located near the center of most normal galaxies.\n\nThe nature of the Milky Way's bar is actively debated, with estimates for its half-length and orientation spanning from 1 to(-) and 10–50 degrees relative to the line of sight from Earth to the Galactic Center. Certain authors advocate that the Milky Way features two distinct bars, one nestled within the other. However, RR Lyr variables do not trace a prominent Galactic bar. The bar may be surrounded by a ring called the \"5-kpc ring\" that contains a large fraction of the molecular hydrogen present in the Milky Way, as well as most of the Milky Way's star-formation activity. Viewed from the Andromeda Galaxy, it would be the brightest feature of the Milky Way. X-ray emission from the core is aligned with the massive stars surrounding the central bar  and the Galactic ridge. \n\nIn 2010, two gigantic spherical bubbles of high energy emission were detected to the north and the south of the Milky Way core, using data of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The diameter of each of the bubbles is about 25000 ly; they stretch up to Grus and to Virgo on the night-sky of the southern hemisphere. Subsequently, observations with the Parkes Telescope at radio frequencies identified polarized emission that is associated with the Fermi bubbles. These observations are best interpreted as a magnetized outflow driven by star formation in the central 640 ly of the Milky Way. \n\nLater, on January 5, 2015, NASA reported observing an X-ray flare 400 times brighter than usual, a record-breaker, from Sagittarius A*, a black hole in the center of the Milky Way. The unusual event may have been caused by the breaking apart of an asteroid falling into the black hole or by the entanglement of magnetic field lines within gas flowing into Sagittarius A*, according to astronomers. \n\nSpiral arms\n \n\nOutside the gravitational influence of the Galactic bars, astronomers generally organize the structure of the interstellar medium and stars in the disk of the Milky Way into four spiral arms. Spiral arms typically contain a higher density of interstellar gas and dust than the Galactic average as well as a greater concentration of star formation, as traced by H II regions and molecular clouds.\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(MILKY WAY<|>NONE<|>PHYSICAL STRUCTURE<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The Milky Way is described as having a bar-shaped core region surrounded by a disk of gas, dust, and stars, with roughly logarithmic spiral arm structures, closely resembling the type Sbc in the Hubble classification.<|>The Milky Way consists of a bar-shaped core region surrounded by a disk of gas, dust and stars.
