Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

There is also a United First International Lounge and United Arrivals Suite in Concourse C near gate C18.\n\nTerminal 1 houses All Nippon Airways's Chicago office. \n\nTerminal 2\n\nTerminal 2 houses Air Canada as well as Delta Air Lines and Delta Connection domestic flights (Delta's wintertime international service between O'Hare and Paris operates from Terminal 5 as the gates in Terminal 2 do not accommodate the Boeing 767-300ER normally assigned to that route). Terminal 2 is also used for most of the United Express operations, although check-in for these flights is conducted at Terminal 1. There is a United Club in Concourse F near gate F8, and a Delta Sky Club on Concourse E near gate E6. United Continental Holdings, United's parent company, is currently upgrading its facilities at Terminal 2, including constructing 10 new jet bridges for the regional flights, reconfiguration of the holding rooms, and a newly constructed United Club as a replacement of the current lounge. \n\nUS Airways previously operated out of Terminal 2 until they moved operations to Terminal 3 in July 2014, so as to be located with its merger partner American Airlines. Check-in for US Airways remained at Terminal 2 until September 16, 2014, in which ticket counters were relocated to Terminal 3. \n\nTerminal 2 has 43 gates on two concourses:\n*Concourse E – 17 gates\n*Concourse F – 26 gates\n\nTerminal 3\n\nTerminal 3 houses all American Airlines flights, as well as departures for select Oneworld carriers including Air Berlin, Iberia, and Japan Airlines, plus unaffiliated low-cost carriers. Terminal 3 has 76 gates on four concourses:\n\n*Concourse G – 25 gates\n*Concourse H – 18 gates\n*Concourse K – 17 gates\n*Concourse L – 16 gates (5 more to be added) \n\nConcourse G houses most of the American Eagle operations, while Concourses H and K house American's mainline operations. American's Oneworld partners Japan Airlines, Air Berlin, and  Iberia depart from K19 and non-affiliated Alaska Airlines operates from H8. Concourse L is used also for some American Eagle flights as well as flights operated by Frontier Airlines, Spirit Airlines, JetBlue, Virgin America and Air Choice One. The City of Chicago and American Airlines have agreed to an extension of the L Concourse to add five new gates. The gates are expected to be used primarily for American Eagle's Embraer E-175 fleet. American has agreed to pay roughly $55 to $75 million and the gates are expected to be completed by 2018.  There are two Admirals Clubs in Terminal 3: one located in the crosswalk area between gates H6 and K6, and a smaller one in Concourse G across from gate G8. American also has a Flagship Lounge located near gate K19.\n\nTerminal 5 (International)\n\nTerminal 5 has 21 gates and is designated on airport maps as Concourse M.\n\nAll of O'Hare's international arrivals (excluding flights from destinations with U.S. border preclearance, which include flights operated by Aer Lingus and Etihad Airways) are processed at Terminal 5. With the exception of select Star Alliance and Oneworld carriers that board from Terminal 1 or Terminal 3 respectively, all non-U.S. carriers except Air Canada depart from Terminal 5 (Delta is the only major U.S. carrier that uses Terminal 5, for its winter seasonal flight to Paris as terminal 2 can not handle the Boeing 767).\n\nTerminal 5 has several airline lounges, including the Air France VIP Lounge, British Airways First Class Galleries and Business Class Terraces Lounge, Korean Air Lounge, Scandinavian Airlines Business Lounge, Swissport Lounge, and Swiss International Air Lines Lounge. The airport's U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility is located at the arrival (lower) level.\n\nTerminal 5 underwent a $26 million renovation designed by A. Epstein and Sons International, Inc., which began in July 2012, which involved adding dining and retail post-security, including many Chicago-based restaurants and brands, updated design, and a re-engineered layout. The project was completed on April 4, 2014. Terminal 5 is run by Westfield Management. \n\nO'Hare is currently in the process of developing a gate capable of accommodating the world's largest passenger aircraft, the Airbus A380. On February 10, 2016 the Chicago Department of Aviation approved the construction to build out a gate that could handle the Airbus aircraft.  The new gate, M11a would be the only gate capable of handling the Airbus A380 and like other gates in Terminal 5 it will be designated as \"common use,\" meaning no specific airline will have exclusive control over it. Emirates and British Airways have expressed interest in using their A380s on routes involving O'Hare. The gate is expected to be operational by late summer of 2016. \n\nPrevious terminal and concourses\n\nOld Terminal 1\n\nTerminal 1 was the original international terminal. It was opened in 1955, it became the international terminal in 1963 and was demolished in 1984 to make way for the current Terminal 1.  It was replaced by a temporary Terminal 4 built in 1984. The terminal was connected to Terminal 2 by a glass-enclosed hallway. It had a Y shaped concourse similar to Concourses H/K in Terminal 3. \n\nConcourse A (Terminal 1)\n\nOld Terminal 1 also had a satellite Concourse A that served commuter airlines.\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4", "temperature": 0.95, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 0.7, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
