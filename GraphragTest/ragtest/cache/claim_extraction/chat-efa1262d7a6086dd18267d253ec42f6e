Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

It is the primary airport serving the Chicago metropolitan area, with Midway International Airport, about 10 mi closer to the Loop, serving as a secondary airport. It is operated by the City of Chicago Department of Aviation.\n\nO'Hare was the busiest airport in the world by number of takeoffs and landings in 2014, beating out Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (which had the title from 2005 to 2013); however, it lost the title back to Atlanta a year later. Until 1998, O'Hare was also the busiest airport in the world in number of passengers. It was surpassed mainly due to limits imposed on the airport by the federal government to reduce flight delays.  As of 2015, O'Hare is the fourth busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic. O'Hare also has the most runways (9) of any major international airport. The largest airlines at O'Hare are United and American.\n\nAs of September 2014, O'Hare has direct service to a total of 210 destinations, including 153 domestic destinations in the United States and 57 international destinations in North America, South America, Asia and Europe. O'Hare is among a select group of airports worldwide with the distinction of serving more than 200 destinations, along with Heathrow, Frankfurt, Istanbul, Amsterdam, Charles de Gaulle, Atlanta, Dallas/Fort Worth, Munich, and Dubai.\n\nO'Hare is currently a major hub for American Airlines and United Airlines, as well as a hub for regional carrier Air Choice One and a focus city for Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines. It is the second largest passenger carrying hub for United after Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport carrying 15.3 million passengers annually, and largest by number of daily flights, operating a total of 585 flights daily.  O'Hare is American's third largest hub, behind Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Charlotte Douglas International Airport, and third largest by number of daily flights, operating a total of 527 daily flights to 120 destinations, including 201 mainline flights daily.  \n\nO'Hare has been voted the \"Best Airport in North America\" for 10 years by two separate sources: Readers of the U.S. Edition of Business Traveler Magazine (1998–2003) and Global Traveler Magazine (2004–2007).   Contrastingly, Travel and Leisure magazine's 2009 \"America's Favorite Cities\" ranked Chicago's Airport System (O'Hare and Midway) the second-worst for delays, New York City's airport system (JFK, Newark Liberty, and LaGuardia) being the first.  O'Hare currently accounts for nearly 20% of the nation's total flight cancellations and delays. \n\nHistory\n\nWorld War II\n\nO'Hare was constructed in 1942–43 as part of a manufacturing plant for Douglas C-54s during World War II.  The site was chosen for its proximity to the city and transportation. The two million square foot (180,000 m²) factory needed easy access to the workforce of the nation's then-second-largest city, as well as its extensive railroad infrastructure. Orchard Place was a small nearby farming community.\n\nDouglas Company's contract ended in 1945 and though plans were proposed to build commercial aircraft, the company ultimately chose to concentrate production on the west coast. With the departure of Douglas; the airfield took the name of Orchard Field Airport, the source of its three-letter IATA code ORD.\n\nIn 1945, Orchard Field was chosen by the city of Chicago as the site for a facility to meet future aviation demands. Matthew Laflin Rockwell (1915–1988) was the director of planning for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and responsible for the site selection and design. He was the great grandson of Matthew Laflin, a founder and pioneer of Chicago.\n\nIn 1949, the airport was renamed O'Hare International Airport to honor Edward O'Hare, the U.S. Navy's first flying ace and Medal of Honor recipient in World War II. Its IATA code, \"ORD\", remained unchanged, however, resulting in O'Hare being one of the rare instances of an airport's three-letter designation bearing no connection to the airport's current name or metropolitan area (with other rare instances including Orlando International Airport's IATA code \"MCO\" or Toronto Pearson International Airport's IATA code of \"YYZ\").\n\nCommercial development\n\nBy the early 1950s, Midway Airport, Chicago's primary airport since 1931, had become too crowded despite multiple expansions and could not handle the planned first generation of jets. The city of Chicago and the FAA began to develop O'Hare as the main airport for Chicago's future.\n\nIn 1953, while traveling to an airshow at Naval Air Station Glenview in Chicago, Illinois, Blue Angels pilot LT Harding MacKnight experienced an engine flameout in his F7U Cutlass, forcing him to make an emergency landing at NAS Glenview. Traveling with him, LT \"Whitey\" Feightner was redirected to make his landing at O'Hare. The runway had just been completed and was covered with peach baskets to prevent aircraft from landing until it was opened. LT Feightner was told to ignore the baskets and land on the new runway. As a result, LT Feightner's F7U became the first aircraft to land on the new runway for O'Hare.\n\nCommercial passenger flights started in 1955 and by the following year O'Hare was served by American, BOAC, Braniff,\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4", "temperature": 0.95, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 0.7, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
