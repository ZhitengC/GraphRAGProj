Due to these impressive preconditions, on 1 October 1273 Rudolph was chosen as the King of the Romans and received the name Rudolph I of Germany.Heinz-Dieter Heimann: Die Habsburger. Dynastie und Kaiserreiche. ISBN 3-406-44754-6.\n\nIn 1282, the Habsburgs gained the rulership of the Duchy of Austria, which they then held for over 600 years, until 1918. Through the forged Privilegium Maius document (1358/59), a special bond was created between the House and Austria. The document, forged at the behest of Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria (1339–1365), also attempted to introduce rules to preserve the unity of the family's Austrian lands. In the long term, this indeed succeeded, but Rudolph's descendants ignored the rule, leading to the separation of the Albertian and Leopoldian family lines in 1379.\n\nBy marrying Elisabeth of Luxembourg, the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund in 1437, Duke Albert V (1397–1439) became the ruler of Bohemia and Hungary, expanding the family's political horizons. The next year, Albert V was crowned as the King of the Romans as Albert II. After his early death in war with the Turks in 1439, and after the death of his son Ladislaus Postumus in 1457, the Habsburgs lost Bohemia and Hungary again. National kingdoms were established in these areas, and the Habsburgs were not able to restore their influence there for decades.\n\nHoly Roman Emperors\n\nIn 1440, Frederick III was chosen by the Electoral College to succeed Albert II as the king. Several Habsburg kings had attempted to gain the imperial throne over the years, but success finally arrived on 19 March 1452 when Pope Nicholas V crowned Frederick III as the Holy Roman Emperor in a grand ceremony held in Rome. In Frederick III, the Pope found an important political ally with whose help he was able to counter the conciliar movement.\n\nWhile in Rome, Frederick III married Eleanor of Portugal, enabling him to build a network of connections with dynasties in the west and southeast of Europe. Frederick was rather distant to his family; Eleanor, by contrast, had a great influence on the raising and education of Frederick's children, and therefore played an important role in the family's rise to prominence. After Frederick III's coronation, the Habsburgs were able to hold the imperial throne almost continuously for centuries, until 1806.\n\nAs Emperor, Frederick III took a leading role inside the family and positioned himself as the judge over the family's internal conflicts, often making use of the privilegium maius. He was able to restore the unity of the house's Austrian lands, as the Albertinian line was now extinct. Territorial integrity was also strengthened by the extinction of the Tyrolean branch of the Leopoldian line in 1490/1496. Frederick's aim was to make Austria a united country, stretching from the Rhine to the Mur and Leitha.\n\nOn the external front, one of Frederick's main achievements was the Siege of Neuss (1474–75), in which he forced Charles the Bold of Burgundy to give his daughter Mary of Burgundy as wife to Frederick's son Maximilian. The wedding took place on the evening of 16 August 1477 and ultimately resulted in the Habsburgs acquiring control of the Low Countries. After Mary's early death in 1482, Maximilian attempted to secure the Burgundian heritance to one of his and Mary's children Philip the Handsome. Charles VIII of France contested this, using both military and dynastic means, but the Burgundian succession was finally ruled in favour of Philip in the Treaty of Senlis in 1493.Erbe, Michael: Die Habsburger 1493-1918. Eine Dynastie im Reich und in Europa. W. Kohlhammer, 2000. ISBN 3-17-011866-8\n\nAfter the death of his father in 1493, Maximilian was proclaimed the new King of the Romans, receiving the name Maximilian I. Maximilian was initially unable to travel to Rome to receive the Imperial title from the Pope, due to opposition from Venice and from the French who were occupying Milan, as well a refusal from the Pope due to enemy forces being present on his territory. In 1508, Maximilian proclaimed himself as the \"chosen Emperor,\" and this was also recognized by the Pope due to changes in political alliances. This had a historical consequence in that, in the future, the Roman King would also automatically become Emperor, without needing the Pope's consent. In 1530, Emperor Charles V became the last person to be crowned as the Emperor by the Pope.\n\nMaximilian's rule (1493–1519) was a time of great expansion for the Habsburgs. In 1497, Maximilian's son Philip the Handsome (also known as Phillip the Fair) married Joanna of Castile, also known as Joan the Mad, heiress of Castile, Aragon, and most of Spain. Phillip and Joan had six children, the eldest of whom became Charles V and inherited the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon (including their colonies in the New World), Southern Italy, Austria, and the Low Countries. \n\nThe foundations for the later empire of Austria-Hungary were laid in 1515 by the means of a double wedding between Louis, only son of Vladislaus II, King of Hungary, and Maximilian's granddaughter Mary; and between her brother Archduke Ferdinand and Vladislaus' daughter Anna. The wedding was celebrated in\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(HOUSE OF HABSBURG<|>DUCHY OF AUSTRIA<|>RULE<|>TRUE<|>1282-01-01T00:00:00<|>1918-12-31T00:00:00<|>The Habsburgs gained the rulership of the Duchy of Austria in 1282 and held it for over 600 years until 1918|>In 1282, the Habsburgs gained the rulership of the Duchy of Austria, which they then held for over 600 years, until 1918.)\n\n##\n(RUDOLF IV, DUKE OF AUSTRIA<|>HOUSE OF HABSBURG<|>FORGED DOCUMENT<|>TRUE<|>1358-01-01T00:00:00<|>1359-12-31T00:00:00<|>Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria, was responsible for the forging of the Privilegium Maius document, attempting to preserve the unity of the family's Austrian lands|>The document, forged at the behest of Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria (1339–1365), also attempted to introduce rules to preserve the unity of the family's Austrian lands.)\n\n##\n(ALBERT V, DUKE OF AUSTRIA<|>BOHEMIA AND HUNGARY<|>RULE<|>TRUE<|>1437-01-01T00:00:00<|>1439-12-31T00:00:00<|>Albert V became the ruler of Bohemia and Hungary through marriage and was crowned as the King of the Romans as Albert II|>By marrying Elisabeth of Luxembourg, the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund in 1437, Duke Albert V (1397–1439) became the ruler of Bohemia and Hungary, expanding the family's political horizons.)\n\n##\n(FREDERICK III, HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE<|>POPE NICHOLAS V<|>ALLIANCE<|>TRUE<|>1452-03-19T00:00:00<|>1452-03-19T00:00:00<|>Frederick III was crowned as the Holy Roman Emperor with the help of Pope Nicholas V, forming an important political alliance|>In Frederick III, the Pope found an important political ally with whose help he was able to counter the conciliar movement.)\n\n##\n(FREDERICK III, HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE<|>HABSBURG FAMILY<|>JUDGEMENT<|>TRUE<|>1452-03-19T00:00:00<|>1493-01-01T00:00:00<|>As Emperor, Frederick III took a leading role inside the family and judged internal conflicts, contributing to the unity of the house's Austrian lands|>As Emperor, Frederick III took a leading role inside the family and positioned himself as the judge over the family's internal conflicts.)\n\n##\n(MAXIMILIAN I, HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE<|>LOW COUNTRIES<|>CONTROL<|>TRUE<|>1477-08-16T00:00:00<|>1493-01-01T00:00:00<|>Maximilian acquired control of the Low Countries through marriage, following the Siege of Neuss|>On the external front, one of Frederick's main achievements was the Siege of Neuss (1474–75), in which he forced Charles the Bold of Burgundy to give his daughter Mary of Burgundy as wife to Frederick's son Maximilian.)\n\n##\n(MAXIMILIAN I, HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE<|>POPE<|>SELF-PROCLAIMATION<|>TRUE<|>1508-01-01T00:00:00<|>1508-12-31T00:00:00<|>Maximilian proclaimed himself as the \"chosen Emperor\" and was recognized by the Pope, changing the historical precedent for the Roman King's automatic transition to Emperor|>Maximilian proclaimed himself as the \"chosen Emperor,\" and this was also recognized by the Pope due to changes in political alliances.)\n\n##\n(MAXIMILIAN I, HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE<|>HOUSE OF HABSBURG<|>EXPANSION<|>TRUE<|>1493-01-01T00:00:00<|>1519-12-31T00:00:00<|>Maximilian's rule was a time of great expansion for the Habsburgs, including the marriage of his son to the heiress of Castile, Aragon, and most of Spain|>Maximilian's rule (1493–1519) was a time of great expansion for the Habsburgs.)\n\n##\n(Louis, SON OF VLADISLAV II<|>MAXIMILIAN'S GRANDDAUGHTER MARY<|>MARRIAGE ALLIANCE<|>TRUE<|>1515-01-01T00:00:00<|>1515-12-31T00:00:00<|>The double wedding between Louis and Maximilian's granddaughter laid the foundation for the later empire of Austria-Hungary|>The foundations for the later empire of Austria-Hungary were laid in 1515 by the means of a double wedding between Louis, only son of Vladislaus II, King of Hungary, and Maximilian's granddaughter Mary.)\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
