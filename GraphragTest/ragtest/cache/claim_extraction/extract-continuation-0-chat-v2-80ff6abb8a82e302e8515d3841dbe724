The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim.

The new 7,500-foot runway will be used almost exclusively for landings toward the east up until 10 p.m. daily. The runway will increase arrival and departure rates at O'Hare by about 25 percent in good weather, all while handling only 5 percent of all daytime flights annually over the next five years. However, the runway sits on the southernmost part of the airfield which aligns roughly with Irving Park Road in Bensenville. Since the runway is several miles from the passenger terminals, the average taxi time is estimated at about 20 minutes. The cost of the runway and a taxiway was $516 million, and they are being controlled by a new air-traffic control tower that cost $41 million to build, according to the FAA and the Chicago Department of Aviation.\n\nIntra-airport transportation\n\nAccess within the airport complex can be accomplished using a -long automated people mover that operates 24 hours a day, connecting all four terminals landside and the remote parking lots. The system began operation on May 6, 1993,  and is now undergoing a US$240 million enhancement to add 15 new cars, upgrade the current infrastructure, and to extend the line to a new consolidated rental car facility where lot F is currently situated. \n\nOther facilities\n\nNippon Cargo Airlines has its Americas regional office on the O'Hare property. \n\nA large air cargo complex on the southwest side of the field was opened in 1984, replacing most of the old cargo area, which stood where Terminal 5 now exists. This complex sits right in the middle of the footprint for new runway 10C/28C, and is to be replaced by a new facility located on the northeastern portion of the airfield. \n\nThe new North Terminal Air Traffic Control Tower was completed in September 2008 and commissioned for use on November 20, 2008.  The new tower was designed by DMJM Aviation-Holmes & Narver Aviation Partners JV (design principal Jose Luis Palacios). \n\nThe USO has a facility in Terminal 2 for the use of military personnel arriving or departing, as well as military recruits going to Recruit Training Command, which has a booth at O'Hare to coordinate transportation to Naval Station Great Lakes for Naval recruits arriving via airplane. \n\nAlong with several other airports around the world, O'Hare has used portions of some of its land to allow urban bee keeping. Intended to raise the environmental profile of airports – with 75 hives, O'Hare is the world's largest airport bee keeper, as of 2015. \n\nTerminals\n\nO'Hare has four numbered passenger terminals with nine lettered concourses and a total of 182 gates. Two or more additional terminal buildings are envisioned; there is the possibility of a large terminal complex for the west side of the field, with access from I-90 and/or the Elgin-O'Hare Expressway, if the runway reconfiguration is completed and passenger numbers require additional terminals.\n\nWith the exception of flights from destinations with U.S. Customs preclearance, all international arrivals at O'Hare arrive at Terminal 5, as the other terminals do not have Customs facilities. Since a number of carriers that have international flights from O'Hare, like United and American, are based in Terminal 1 or Terminal 3, those airlines will have their aircraft offloaded at Terminal 5 and then, after passengers are offloaded, the plane is towed empty back to a gate at the airline's assigned terminal for boarding. This is done, in part to make connections for passengers transferring from domestic flights to international flights easier, since while Terminals 1, 2, and 3 allow airside connections between each other via a long corridor, Terminal 5 is separated from the other terminals by a set of taxiways that cross over the airport's access road, requiring passengers to exit security, ride the Airport Transit System, then reclear security in either direction.\n\nTerminal 1\n\nTerminal 1 is used for United Airlines flights, including all mainline flights and some United Express operations, as well as flights for Star Alliance partners Lufthansa and All Nippon Airways. It has 50 gates on two concourses:\n\n*Concourse B – 22 gates\n*Concourse C – 28 gates\n\nConcourses B and C are linear concourses located in separate buildings parallel to each other. Concourse B is adjacent to the airport roadway and houses passenger check-in, baggage claim and security screening on its landside and aircraft gates on its airside. Concourse C is a satellite terminal with gates on all sides, in the middle of the ramp, and is connected to Concourse B via an underground pedestrian tunnel under the ramp. The tunnel originates between gates B8 and B9 in Concourse B, and ends on Concourse C between gates C17 and C19. The tunnel is illuminated with a neon installation titled Sky's the Limit (1987) by Canadian artist Michael Hayden, which plays an airy and very slow-tempo version of \"Rhapsody in Blue\".\n\nUnited also runs a post-security shuttle bus service between Concourse C (at gate C9) in Terminal 1 and Concourses E & F (at gate E4) in Terminal 2. There are three United Clubs in Terminal 1: one on Concourse B near gate B6, one located near gate B16, and one on Concourse C near gate C16. There is also a United First International Lounge and United Arrivals Suite in Concourse C near gate C18.\n\nTerminal 1 houses All Nippon Airways's Chicago office. \n\nTerminal 2\n\nTerminal 2 houses Air Canada as well as Delta Air Lines and Delta Connection domestic flights (Delta's wintertime international service between O'Hare\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(O'HARE<|>NONE<|>INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT<|>TRUE<|>2015-01-01T00:00:00<|>2015-12-31T00:00:00<|>O'Hare's Runway 10R/28L was commissioned, which is expected to increase arrival and departure rates by about 25 percent in good weather and handle 5 percent of all daytime flights annually over the next five years.
