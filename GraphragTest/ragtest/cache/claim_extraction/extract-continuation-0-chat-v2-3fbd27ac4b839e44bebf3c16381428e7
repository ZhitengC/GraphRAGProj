Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

All this was surrounded by the collar Order of the Golden Fleece  \n\nIn the heraldic composition of 1915, the shields of the two foci of the empire, Austria and Hungary, were brought together. The griffin supporter on the left was added for Austria and an angel on the right as a supporter for Hungary. The center featured the personal arms of the Habsburgs (Habsburg, Austria and Lorraine). This small shield was topped with a royal crown and surrounded by the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece, below which was the Military Order of Maria Theresa, below which was the collars of the Orders of St. Stephen's and Leopold. At the bottom was the motto that read \"AC INDIVISIBILITER INSEPARABILITER\" (\"indivisible and inseparable\"). There were other simplified versions which did not have the supports depicted, and the simple shields of Austria and Hungary.  These were the arms of the Empire of Austria with an inescutcheon of Austria, and the Arms of Hungary (with chequer of Croatia at the tip).\n\nGallery\nAnswer these questions:\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Since the provided text does not contain explicit claims that could be relevant to information discovery against specified entities such as organizations, persons, geos, or events, and there is no explicit mention of any red flags or controversial facts, the output will be a list of entities without any associated claims.\n\nBased on the entity specification of ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event'], here are the identified entities from the text:\n\n- Organization: Order of the Golden Fleece, Military Order of Maria Theresa, Orders of St. Stephen's, Orders of Leopold\n- Person: Habsburgs\n- Geo: Austria, Hungary, Croatia\n- Event: heraldic composition of 1915\n\nHowever, there are no specific claims that can be extracted regarding these entities that match the claim description provided.
