Today, the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the proposed Pebble Mine.\n\nAlaska Heritage Resources Survey\n\nThe Alaska Heritage Resources Survey (AHRS) is a restricted inventory of all reported historic and prehistoric sites within the state of Alaska; it is maintained by the Office of History and Archaeology. The survey's inventory of cultural resources includes objects, structures, buildings, sites, districts, and travel ways, with a general provision that they are over 50 years old. As of January 31, 2012, over 35,000 sites have been reported. \n\nDemographics\n\nThe United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Alaska was 738,432 on July 1, 2015, a 3.97% increase since the 2010 United States Census.\n\nIn 2010, Alaska ranked as the 47th state by population, ahead of North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming (and Washington, D.C.) Alaska is the least densely populated state, and one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world, at , with the next state, Wyoming, at .  Alaska is the largest U.S. state by area, and the tenth wealthiest (per capita income).  As of November 2014, the state's unemployment rate was 6.6%. \n\nRace and ancestry\n\nAccording to the 2010 United States Census, Alaska had a population of 710,231. In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 66.7% White (64.1% Non-Hispanic White), 14.8% American Indian and Alaska Native, 5.4% Asian, 3.3% Black or African American, 1.0% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 1.6% from Some Other Race, and 7.3% from Two or More Races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race made up 5.5% of the population. \n\n, 50.7% of Alaska's population younger than one year of age belonged to minority groups (i.e., did not have two parents of non-Hispanic white ancestry). \n\nLanguages\n\nAccording to the 2011 American Community Survey, 83.4% of people over the age of five speak only English at home. About 3.5% speak Spanish at home. About 2.2% speak another Indo-European language at home and about 4.3% speak an Asian language at home. About 5.3% speak other languages at home. \n\nThe Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks claims that at least 20 Alaskan native languages exist and there are also some languages with different dialects.  Most of Alaska's native languages belong to either the Eskimo–Aleut or Na-Dene language families however some languages are thought to be isolates (e.g. Haida) or have not yet been classified (e.g. Tsimshianic).\n nearly all of Alaska's native languages were classified as either threatened, shifting, moribund, nearly extinct, or dormant languages. \n\nA total of 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the state's 20 indigenous languages, known locally as \"native languages\".\n\nIn October 2014, the governor of Alaska signed a bill declaring the state's 20 indigenous languages as official languages.   This bill gave the languages symbolic recognition as official languages, though they have not been adopted for official use within the government. The 20 languages that were included in the bill are:\n# Inupiaq\n# Siberian Yupik\n# Central Alaskan Yup’ik\n# Alutiiq\n# Unangax\n# Dena’ina\n# Deg Xinag\n# Holikachuk\n# Koyukon\n# Upper Kuskokwim\n# Gwich’in\n# Tanana\n# Upper Tanana\n# Tanacross\n# Hän\n# Ahtna\n# Eyak\n# Tlingit\n# Haida\n# Tsimshian\n\nReligion\n\nAccording to statistics collected by the Association of Religion Data Archives from 2010, about 34% of Alaska residents were members of religious congregations. 100,960 people identified as Evangelical Protestants, 50,866 as Roman Catholic, and 32,550 as mainline Protestants.  Roughly 4% are Mormon, 0.5% are Jewish, 1% are Muslim, 0.5% are Buddhist, and 0.5% are Hindu.   The largest religious denominations in Alaska  were the Catholic Church with 50,866 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestants with 38,070 adherents, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 32,170 adherents, and the Southern Baptist Convention with 19,891 adherents.   Alaska has been identified, along with Pacific Northwest states Washington and Oregon, as being the least religious states of the USA, in terms of church membership.  \n\nIn 1795, the First Russian Orthodox Church was established in Kodiak. Intermarriage with Alaskan Natives helped the Russian immigrants integrate into society. As a result, an increasing number of Russian Orthodox churches gradually became established within Alaska.  Alaska also has the largest Quaker population (by percentage) of any state.  In 2009 there were 6,000 Jews in Alaska (for whom observance of halakha may pose special problems).  Alaskan Hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other Asian religious communities, including Sikhs and Jains.   \n\nEstimates for the\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE<|>NONE<|>ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROVERSY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the subject of a contentious debate over oil drilling<|>Today, the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the proposed Pebble Mine.)\n##\n(PEBBLE MINE<|>NONE<|>ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROVERSY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The proposed Pebble Mine is a source of environmental controversy<|>Today, the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the proposed Pebble Mine.)\n##\n(ALASKA HERITAGE RESOURCES SURVEY<|>NONE<|>CULTURAL PRESERVATION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The Alaska Heritage Resources Survey is a restricted inventory of reported historic and prehistoric sites within Alaska|>The Alaska Heritage Resources Survey (AHRS) is a restricted inventory of all reported historic and prehistoric sites within the state of Alaska; it is maintained by the Office of History and Archaeology.)\n##\n(OFFICE OF HISTORY AND ARCHAEOLOGY<|>ALASKA HERITAGE RESOURCES SURVEY<|>ENTITY RESPONSIBILITY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The Office of History and Archaeology maintains the Alaska Heritage Resources Survey<|>The survey's inventory of cultural resources includes objects, structures, buildings, sites, districts, and travel ways, with a general provision that they are over 50 years old; it is maintained by the Office of History and Archaeology.)\n##\n(UNITED STATES CENSUS BUREAU<|>NONE<|>DEMOGRAPHIC SURVEY<|>TRUE<|>2015-07-01T00:00:00<|>2015-07-01T00:00:00<|>The United States Census Bureau estimated Alaska's population to be 738,432 on July 1, 2015<|>The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Alaska was 738,432 on July 1, 2015, a 3.97% increase since the 2010 United States Census.)\n##\n(ALASKA<|>NONE<|>POPULATION STATISTICS<|>TRUE<|>2010-01-01T00:00:00<|>2010-12-31T00:00:00<|>Alaska had a population of 710,231 according to the 2010 United States Census<|>According to the 2010 United States Census, Alaska had a population of 710,231.)\n##\n(ALASKA<|>NONE<|>ETHNIC DIVERSITY<|>TRUE<|>2010-01-01T00:00:00<|>2010-12-31T00:00:00<|>Alaska's population is diverse, with multiple ethnicities represented<|>In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 66.7% White (64.1% Non-Hispanic White), 14.8% American Indian and Alaska Native, 5.4% Asian, 3.3% Black or African American, 1.0% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 1.6% from Some Other Race, and 7.3% from Two or More Races.)\n##\n(ALASKA NATIVE LANGUAGE CENTER<|>NONE<|>LANGUAGE PRESERVATION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>The Alaska Native Language Center claims that at least 20 Alaskan native languages exist<|>The Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks claims that at least 20 Alaskan native languages exist)\n##\n(ALASKA<|>NONE<|>LANGUAGE POLICY<|>TRUE<|>2014-10-01T00:00:00<|>2014-10-31T00:00:00<|>The governor of Alaska signed a bill declaring the state's 20 indigenous languages as official languages<|>In October 2014, the governor of Alaska signed a bill declaring the state's 20 indigenous languages as official languages.)\n##\n(ALASKA<|>NONE<|>RELIGIOUS STATISTICS<|>TRUE<|>2010-01-01T00:00:00<|>2010-12-31T00:00:00<|>About 34% of Alaska residents were members of religious congregations according to 2010 statistics<|>According to statistics collected by the Association of Religion Data Archives from 2010, about 34% of Alaska residents were members of religious congregations.)\n##\n(ALASKA<|>NONE<|>RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Alaska has a variety of religious denominations, including Evangelical Protestants, Roman Catholic, and mainline Protestants<|>100,960 people identified as Evangelical Protestants, 50,866 as Roman Catholic, and 32,550 as mainline Protestants.)\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
