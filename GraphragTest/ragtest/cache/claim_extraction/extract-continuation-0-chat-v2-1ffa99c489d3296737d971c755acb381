With writer/editors Stefan and Unn Printz-Påhlson, Vicar created the character Oona, a prehistoric duck princess who traveled to modern Duckburg by using Gyro's time-machine. She stayed, and is still seen in occasional modern stories.\n\nThe best-known and most popular Duck-artist of this time is American Don Rosa. He started doing Disney comics in 1987 for the American publisher Gladstone. He later worked briefly for the Dutch editors, but moved to work directly for Egmont soon afterwards. His stories contain many direct references to stories by Carl Barks, and he also wrote and illustrated a 12-part series of stories about the life of Scrooge McDuck, which won him two Eisner Awards.\n\nOther important artists who have worked with Donald are Freddy Milton and Daan Jippes, who made 18 ten-pagers which experts claim, were very difficult to separate from Barks' own work from the late 1940s.\n\nJapanese artist Shiro Amano worked with Donald on the graphic novel Kingdom Hearts based on the Disney-Square Enix videogame.\n\nDonald Duck outside the United States\n\nDonald Duck has a slightly different character abroad.\n\nNordic countries\n\nDonald Duck (Kalle Anka in Sweden,  Anders And in Denmark, Andrés Önd in Iceland, Donald Duck in Norway,  and Aku Ankka in Finland) is a very popular character in Nordic countries. In the mid-1930s, Robert S. Hartman, a German who served as a representative of Walt Disney, visited Sweden to supervise the merchandise distribution of Sagokonst (The Art of Fables). Hartman found a studio called L'Ateljé Dekoratör, which produced illustrated cards that were published by Sagokonst. Since the Disney characters on the cards appeared to be exactly 'on-model', Hartman asked the studio to create a local version of the English-language Mickey Mouse Weekly. In 1937 L'Ateljé Dekoratör began publishing Musse Pigg Tidningen (Mickey Mouse Magazine), which had high production values and spanned 23 issues; most of the magazine's content came from local producers, while some material consisted of reprints from Mickey Mouse Weekly. The comic anthology ended in 1938. Hartman helped Disney establish offices in all Nordic countries before he left Disney in 1941. Donald became the most popular of the Disney characters in Scandinavia, and Scandinavians recognise him better than Mickey Mouse. Kalle Anka & Co, Donald's first dedicated Swedish anthology, started in September 1948. In 2001 the Finnish Post Office issued a stamp set to commemorate the 50th year anniversary of Donald's presence in Finland. By 2005 around one out of every four Norwegians read the Norwegian edition Donald Duck & Co. per week, translating to around 1.3 million regular readers. During the same year, every week 434,000 Swedes read Kalle Anka & Co. By 2005 in Finland the Donald Duck anthology Aku Ankka sold 270,000 copies per issue. Tim Pilcher and Brad Books, authors of The Essential Guide to World Comics, described the Donald anthologies as \"the Scandinavian equivalent of the UK's Beano or Dandy, a comic that generations have grown up with, from grandparents to grandchildren.\"\n\nHannu Raittila, an author, says that Finnish people recognize an aspect of themselves in Donald; Raittila cites that Donald attempts to retrieve himself from \"all manner of unexpected and unreasonable scrapes using only his wits and the slim resources he can put his hands on, all of which meshes nicely with the popular image of Finland as driftwood in the crosscurrents of world politics.\" Finnish voters placing protest votes typically write \"Donald Duck\" as the candidate.  In Sweden voters often voted for Donald Duck or the Donald Duck Party as a nonexistent candidate until a 2006 change in voting laws, which prohibited voting for nonexistent candidates. In a twenty-year span Donald won enough votes to be, in theory, Sweden's ninth-most popular political organization. In 1985 Donald received 291 votes in an election for the Parliament of Sweden (Riksdag). \n\nBy 1978, within Finland there was debate over the morality of Donald Duck. Matti Holopainen jokingly criticized Donald for living with Daisy while not being married to her, for not wearing trousers, and for, in the words of the Library Journal, being \"too bourgeois\".   Some observers from Finland from the same time period supported Donald, referring to him as a \"genuine proletarian...forced to sell his labor at slave rates to make a living\". The Library Journal stated that it had been revealed that, since 1950, Donald had secretly been married to Daisy. \nAn annual Christmas special in Norway, Denmark, Finland and Sweden is From All of Us to All of You, in Norway and Sweden with a title of Donald Duck and His Friends Celebrate Christmas. Segments include Ferdinand the Bull, a short with Chip 'n' Dale, a segment from Lady and the Tramp, a sneak preview of a coming Disney movie and concludes with Jiminy Cricket performing \"When You Wish Upon a Star\". To many people watching this special is a tradition as important as having a Christmas tree.\n\nGermany\n\nDonald Duck is very popular in Germany, where Donald themed comics sell an average of 250,000 copies each week, mostly published in the kids' weekly Micky Maus and the monthly Donald Duck Special (for adults). The Wall Street Journal called Donald Duck \"The Jerry Lewis of Germany\", a reference to American star Jerry Lewis' popularity in France.[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB100014240529702037719045\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(DONALD DUCK<|>EGMONT<|>CHARACTER CREATION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Donald Duck's character Oona was created in collaboration with writer/editors Stefan and Unn Printz-Påhlson, and is still seen in modern stories.||>With writer/editors Stefan and Unn Printz-Påhlson, Vicar created the character Oona, a prehistoric duck princess who traveled to modern Duckburg by using Gyro's time-machine.)\n\n##\n(DON ROSA<|>GLADSTONE<|>COMICS PUBLISHING<|>TRUE<|>1987-01-01T00:00:00<|>1987-12-31T00:00:00<|>Don Rosa started doing Disney comics for the American publisher Gladstone in 1987, and later worked for Egmont.||>He started doing Disney comics in 1987 for the American publisher Gladstone.
