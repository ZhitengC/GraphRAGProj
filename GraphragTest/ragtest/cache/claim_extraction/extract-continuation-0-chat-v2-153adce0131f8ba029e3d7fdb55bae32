Kant also conjectured that some of the nebulae visible in the night sky might be separate \"galaxies\" themselves, similar to our own. Kant referred to both the Milky Way and the \"extragalactic nebulae\" as \"island universes\", a term still current up to the 1930s. The term Weltinsel (island universe) appears nowhere in Kant's book of 1755.  The term first appeared in 1850, in the third volume of von Humboldt's Kosmos:  Alexander von Humboldt, Kosmos … , vol. 3 (Stuttgart & Tübingen, (Germany):  J.G. Cotta, 1850), pages 187, 189.  [https://books.google.com/books?id\nSu0iAQAAMAAJ&pgPA187#v\nonepage&q&f=false From page 187:]  \"Thomas Wright von Durham, Kant, Lambert und zuerst auch William Herschel waren geneigt die Gestalt der Milchstraße und die scheinbare Anhäufung der Sterne in derselben als eine Folge der abgeplatteten Gestalt und ungleichen Dimensionen der Weltinsel (Sternschict) zu betrachten, in welche unser Sonnensystem eingeschlossen ist.\"  (Thomas Wright of Durham, Kant, Lambert and first of all also William Herschel were inclined to regard the shape of the Milky Way and the apparent clustering of stars in it as a consequence of the oblate shape and unequal dimensions of the world island (star stratum), in which our solar system is included.)\nIn the English translation—Alexander von Humboldt with E.C. Otté, trans., Cosmos … (New York City:  Harper & Brothers, 1897), vols. 3–5—see [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?idnjp.32101057350447;view\n1up;seq=157 page 147].\n\nThe first attempt to describe the shape of the Milky Way and the position of the Sun within it was carried out by William Herschel in 1785 by carefully counting the number of stars in different regions of the visible sky. He produced a diagram of the shape of the Milky Way with the Solar System close to the center. \n\nIn 1845, Lord Rosse constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish between elliptical and spiral-shaped nebulae. He also managed to make out individual point sources in some of these nebulae, lending credence to Kant's earlier conjecture.\n\nIn 1917, Heber Curtis had observed the nova S Andromedae within the Great Andromeda Nebula (Messier object 31). Searching the photographic record, he found 11 more novae. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 magnitudes fainter than those that occurred within the Milky Way. As a result, he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 150,000 parsecs. He became a proponent of the \"island universes\" hypothesis, which held that the spiral nebulae were actually independent galaxies. In 1920 the Great Debate took place between Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, concerning the nature of the Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the Universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula is an external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in the Milky Way, as well as the significant Doppler shift.\n\nThe controversy was conclusively settled by Edwin Hubble in the early 1920s using the Mount Wilson observatory 2.5 m Hooker telescope. With the light-gathering power of this new telescope he was able to produce astronomical photographs that resolved the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars. He was also able to identify some Cepheid variables that he could use as a benchmark to estimate the distance to the nebulae. He found that the Andromeda Nebula is 275,000 parsecs from the Sun, far too distant to be part of the Milky Way.\nAnswer these questions:\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the provided text, the entity specification, and the claim description, here are the extracted claims:\n\n1.
