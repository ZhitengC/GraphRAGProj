As a result, it was not an automatically inherited position. Until the rule of Ferdinand I, Habsburgs didn't gain hereditary accession to the throne and were displaced by other dynasties. Hence, the kings of Bohemia and their ruling dates are listed separately. The Habsburgs became hereditary kings of Bohemia in 1627.

They were known as \"of\" (in German von) based on the main territory they ruled.  For example, sons, daughters, grandsons and granddaughters of a ruling French King were known as \"of France\" (see Wikipedia on House of Bourbon).  The name \"Capet\" was an invention of the French Revolutionaries.  \"Bourbon\" was in some sense the name of the house as it was differentiated from the previous Valois kings.  Princes and Princesses of the royal house of England were known as \"of England\", or later \"Great Britain\" (see House of Windsor) or \"of\" the main title associated with their parent (see Prince William of Wales). In the Middle Ages, princes of England were often known by the town or castle of their birth (see John of Gaunt, Henry Bolingbroke, or Henry of Monmouth). Even when the royal family had a last name (see House of Tudor, House of Stuart or House of Windsor), it was not used in their titles.\n\nSimilarly, the Habsburg name was used as one of the subsidiary titles of the rulers above, as in \"Princely Count of Habsburg\" (see above under Habsburg-Lorraine).  The Habsburg arms (see above) were displayed only in the most complete (great arms) of the prince.  The dynasty was known as the \"house of Austria\".  Most of the princes above were known as Archduke xyz \"of Austria\" and had no need of a surname. Charles V was known in his youth after his birthplace as \"Charles of Ghent\".  When he became king of the Spains he was known as \"Charles of Spain\", until he became emperor, when he was known as Charles V (\"Charles Quint\").  In Spain, the dynasty was known as the \"casa de Austria\", and illegitimate sons were given the title of \"de Austria\" (see Don Juan de Austria and Don Juan José de Austria).  The arms displayed in their simplest form were those of Austria, which the Habsburgs had made their own, at times impaled with the arms of the Duchy of Burgundy (ancient).\n\nWhen Maria Theresa married the duke of Lorraine, Francis Stephen (see above), there was a desire to show that the ruling dynasty continued as did all its inherited rights, as the ruling dynasty's right to rule was based on inherited legitimate birthright in each of the constituent territories.  Using the concept of \"Habsburg\" as the traditional Austrian ruler was one of those ways.  When Francis I became Emperor of Austria, there was an even further reinforcement of this by the reappearance of the arms of Habsburg in the tripart personal arms of the house with Austria and Lorraine.  This also reinforced the \"Germaness\" of the Austrian Emperor and his claim to rule in Germany against the Prussian Kings, or at least to be included in \"Germany\".
