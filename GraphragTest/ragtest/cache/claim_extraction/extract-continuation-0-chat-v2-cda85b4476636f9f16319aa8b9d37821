The strip is bounded on the north by Rosemont and the south by Schiller Park. \n\nRunways\n\nOn October 17, 2013 O'Hare opened Runway 10C-28C. The opening of this eighth runway marked the completion of the Phase II expansion project. O'Hare landings have been reconfigured to predominately use a triple arrival scheme utilizing three of the four parallel runways, with the fourth runway being used for takeoffs.\n\nBefore the opening of 10C-28C, the new runway, 9L/27R which opened in November 2008, O'Hare had seven runways in three roughly-parallel sets. The longest is Runway 10Lâ€“28R, 13001 x. Runways 9L, 10C, 10L, 14R, 27L, 27R, 28C and 28R have Category III instrument landing systems (ILS),  allowing trained aircrews to conduct landings with as little as 600 ft of horizontal visibility. All other runway approaches except 4L and 32L have full Category I ILS. Runway 4L is seldom used for landings and has a localizer, the horizontal guidance component of an ILS system, but does not have a glide slope, the vertical component. Runway 32L was permanently closed to landings when the section south of the crossing with Runway 10L/28R was closed due to 10C/28C construction. \n\nPrior to the runway reconfiguration, all of O'Hare's runways intersected each other with the exception of 4R/22L. This created problems in inclement weather, busy times, or high winds, and several near-collisions. The redevelopment, which essentially eliminates most active runway intersections, is intended to reduce collision hazards and delays.\n\nThe field started with four clustered runways; in March 1950 all were 5500 to(-) long. Runway 14 (later 14L) became 7345 ft around 1952; the 8000 ft Runway 14R/32L opened in 1956 and became 11600 ft long in 1960. The 10000 ft 9R/27L (now designated 10L/28R) opened in 1968 and 14L became 10000 ft long around the same time. 4R/22L opened in 1971 and the new 9L/27R in 2008. In 2003 the fourth original runway, (18/36) closed; its short length, lack of use, and placement no longer justified certification. Runway 18/36 is now Taxiway M on airport charts. On August 19, 2015, Runway 14L/32R was closed. \n\nThe redevelopment, when completed, will remove the two northwestâ€“southeast runways (14/32 L/R), construct four additional eastâ€“west runways (10C/28C, 10R/28L, 9L/27R, and 9C/27C), and extend the existing eastâ€“west runways (9R/27L and 10L/28R). The two existing northeastâ€“southwest (4/22 L/R) runways will be retained. Currently, three of the four new runways have been constructed (9L/27R, 10C/28C, and 10R/28L), and one of the two extensions (10L/28R) has been completed.\n\nIn the earlier airfield layout, 32L was often used for takeoffs in a shortened configuration. Planes reached the runway at Taxiway T10 (common) or Taxiway N, formerly M (not common). This shortened the runway but allowed operations on Runway 10L/28R to continue without restriction. The full length of the runway was available upon request, though with the extension of 10L/28R it was usually not needed. In May 2010 Runway 14R/32L was permanently shortened to 9685 ft and it now starts at Taxiway N.\n\nO'Hare has a voluntary nighttime (2200â€“0700) noise abatement program. \n\nThe runway reconfiguration at O'Hare will also improve the airport for future Airbus A380 service. On July 5, 2007 the runway previously designated 9R/27L became runway 10/28. On May 2, 2013, that same runway (10/28) became 10L/28R. On August 30, 2007, runway 9L/27R became 9R/27L. \n\nOn September 25, 2008, a 2857 ft extension to 10L/28R opened.  On May 2, 2013, airport diagrams published by the FAA depicted the runway previously designated 10/28 as 10L/28R. \n\nRunway 10C/28C was commissioned and opened for regular use on October 17, 2013. On October 17, 2013, airport diagrams published by the FAA depicted the runway as open.\n\nOn October 15, 2015, Runway 10R/28L was commissioned. The new 7,500-foot runway will be used almost exclusively for landings toward the east up until 10 p.m. daily. The runway will increase arrival and departure rates at O'Hare by about 25 percent in good weather, all while handling only 5 percent of all daytime flights annually over the next five years. However, the runway sits on the southernmost part of the airfield which aligns roughly\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(O'HARE<|>NONE<|>RUNWAY EXPANSION<|>TRUE<|>2008-11-01T00:00:00<|>2013-10-17T00:00:00<|>O'Hare airport completed Phase II of its expansion project with the opening of Runway 10C-28C on October 17, 2013, which was part of a larger reconfiguration to reduce collision hazards and delays, and to improve the airport's capacity<|>On October 17, 2013 O'Hare opened Runway 10C-28C.
