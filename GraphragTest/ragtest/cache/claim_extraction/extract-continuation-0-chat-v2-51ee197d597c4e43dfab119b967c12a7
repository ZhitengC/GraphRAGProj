Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made.

In the UK and Ireland, it also means poor quality or counterfeit. However, in parts of Australia it can mean excellent or very good (rhyming slang for \"grouse\").  Examples of the former two of the three usages include the following.\n* During World War II, the Motor Minesweepers used by the British Royal Naval Patrol Service were unofficially known as \"Mickey Mouses.\"\n* In The Godfather Part II, Fredo's justification of betraying Michael is that his orders in the family usually were \"Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo off to do that! Let Fredo take care of some Mickey Mouse night club somewhere!\" as opposed to more meaningful tasks.\n* In an early episode of the 1978–82 sitcom Mork & Mindy, Mork stated that Pluto was \"a Mickey Mouse planet,\" referring to the future dwarf planet having the same name as Mickey's pet dog Pluto. Actually, the planet was named shortly before the dog was.\n* In 1984, just after an ice hockey game in which Wayne Gretzky's Edmonton Oilers beat the New Jersey Devils 13–4, Gretzky was quoted as saying to a reporter, \"Well, it's time they got their act together, they're ruining the whole league. They had better stop running a Mickey Mouse organization and put somebody on the ice\". Reacting to Gretzky's comment, Devils fans wore Mickey Mouse apparel when the Oilers returned to New Jersey. \n* In the 1993 Warner Bros. film Demolition Man, as Sylvester Stallone's character is fighting the malfunctioning AI of his out-of-control police car, he shouts for the system to \"Brake! Brake! Brake now, you Mickey Mouse piece of shit!\" \n* In the 1996 Warner Bros. film Space Jam, Bugs Bunny derogatorily comments on Daffy Duck's idea for the name of their basketball team, asking: \"What kind of Mickey Mouse organization would name a team 'The Ducks?'\" (This also referenced the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, a NHL team that was then owned by Disney, as well as the Disney-made \"The Mighty Ducks\" movie franchise. This was referencing the Disney/Warner Brothers rivalry.)\n* In the United States armed forces, actions that look good but have little or no practical use (such as the specific manner of making beds in basic training or the polishing of brass fittings on board ship) are commonly referred to as \"Mickey Mouse work.\"\n* In schools a \"Mickey Mouse course,\" \"Mickey Mouse major,\" or \"Mickey Mouse degree\" is a class, college major, or degree where very little effort is necessary in order to attain a good grade (especially an A) and/or one where the subject matter of such a class is not of any importance in the labor market. \n* Musicians often refer to a film score that directly follows each action on screen as Mickey Mousing (also mickey-mousing and mickeymousing). \n* Software company Microsoft has been derogatorily called \"Mickeysoft\". \n* In the beginning of the 1980s, then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once called the European Parliament a \"Mickey Mouse parliament\", meaning a discussion club without influence. \n* In the British sitcom Red Dwarf, in the episode \"Quarantine\", after the team's substandard equipment nearly cost them their lives, Lister pointed out, \"We're a real Mickey Mouse operation, aren't we?\" The Cat replied, \"Mickey Mouse? We ain't even Betty Boop!\"\n* The combined road course at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway used for the F1 U.S. Grand Prix has been described by Jacques Villeneuve and other competitors as \"Mickey Mouse\"  due to its slow uninteresting corners, and lack of challenging corners.\n\nParodies and criticism\n\nMickey Mouse's global fame has made him both a symbol of The Walt Disney Company and of the United States itself. For this reason Mickey has been used frequently in anti-American satire, such as the infamous underground cartoon \"Mickey Mouse in Vietnam\". There have been numerous parodies of Mickey Mouse, such as the Mad Magazine parody \"Mickey Rodent\" by Will Elder in which the mouse walks around unshaven and jails Donald Duck out of jealousy over the duck's larger popularity.  The grotesque Rat Fink character was created by Ed \"Big Daddy\" Roth over his hatred of Mickey Mouse. In The Simpsons Movie, Bart Simpson puts a black bra on his head to mimic Mickey Mouse and says: \"I'm the mascot of an evil corporation!\"  On the Comedy Central series South Park, Mickey is depicted as the sadistic, greedy, foul-mouthed boss of The Walt Disney Company, only interested in money. He also appears briefly with Donald Duck in the comic Squeak the Mouse by the Italian cartoonist Massimo Mattioli.\n\nIn an episode of \"Full Frontal Nerdity,\" by Aaron Williams, Mickey is shown as desperately trying to unload Miramax. \n\nIn Bored of the Rings, Mickey Mouse is satirized as Dickey Dragon.\n\nLegal issues\n\nLike all major Disney characters, Mickey Mouse is not only copyrighted, but also trademarked, which lasts in perpetuity as long as it continues to be used commercially by its owner. So, whether or not a particular Disney cartoon goes into the public domain, the characters themselves may not be used as trademarks without authorization.\n\nBecause of the Copyright Term Extension Act of the United States (sometimes called the 'Mickey Mouse Protection Act' because of extensive lobbying by the Disney corporation)\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(GEO<|>NONE<|>VOTER FRAUD<|>SUSPECTED<|>2008-01-01T00:00:00<|>2008-12-31T00:00:00<|>Voter registration lists appeared fraudulently, most recently in the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election.||\"appear fraudulently on voter registration lists, most recently in the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election.\")\n\n## \n\n(ORGANIZATION<|>NONE<|>DEROGATORY USE<|>TRUE<|>1940-01-01T00:00:00<|>2023-12-31T00:00:00<|>\"Mickey Mouse\" is used as a slang expression for various negative connotations, including small-time, amateurish, trivial, poor quality, and counterfeit.|*\"During World War II, the Motor Minesweepers used by the British Royal Naval Patrol Service were unofficially known as 'Mickey Mouses.'\")\n\n## \n\n(PERSON<|>NONE<|>PARODY AND CRITICISM<|>TRUE<|>1960-01-01T00:00:00<|>2023-12-31T00:00:00<|>Mickey Mouse has been used in anti-American satire and has been the subject of numerous parodies and criticisms.|*\"Mickey has been used frequently in anti-American satire, such as the infamous underground cartoon 'Mickey Mouse in Vietnam'.
