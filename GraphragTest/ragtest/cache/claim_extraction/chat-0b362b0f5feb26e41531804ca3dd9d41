Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

In his view, the Milky Way is celestial. This idea would be influential later in the Islamic world.\n\nThe Persian astronomer Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī (973–1048) proposed that the Milky Way is \"a collection of countless fragments of the nature of nebulous stars\". The Andalusian astronomer Avempace ( 1138) proposed the Milky Way to be made up of many stars but appears to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction in Earth's atmosphere, citing his observation of a conjunction of Jupiter and Mars in 1106 or 1107 as evidence. Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292–1350) proposed that the Milky Way is \"a myriad of tiny stars packed together in the sphere of the fixed stars\" and that these stars are larger than planets.\n\nAccording to Jamil Ragep, the Persian astronomer Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī (1201–1274) in his Tadhkira writes:\n\"The Milky Way, i.e. the Galaxy, is made up of a very large number of small, tightly clustered stars, which, on account of their concentration and smallness, seem to be cloudy patches. Because of this, it was likened to milk in color.\"\n\nActual proof of the Milky Way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study the Milky Way and discovered that it is composed of a huge number of faint stars.Galileo Galilei, Sidereus Nuncius (Venice, (Italy):  Thomas Baglioni, 1610), [https://archive.org/stream/Sidereusnuncius00Gali#page/n37/mode/2up pages 15 and 16.]\nEnglish translation:  Galileo Galilei with Edward Stafford Carlos, trans., The Sidereal Messenger (London, England:  Rivingtons, 1880), [https://archive.org/stream/siderealmessenge80gali#page/42/mode/2up/ pages 42 and 43.] In a treatise in 1755, Immanuel Kant, drawing on earlier work by Thomas Wright,Thomas Wright, An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe … (London, England:  H.

The resulting disk of stars would be seen as a band on the sky from our perspective inside the disk.

Kant referred to both the Milky Way and the \"extragalactic nebulae\" as \"island universes\", a term still current up to the 1930s.
