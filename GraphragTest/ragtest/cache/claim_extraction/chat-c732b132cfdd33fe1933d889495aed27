{"result": "most important thing to consider when analyzing claims against certain entities in a text document is to accurately identify the entities and the claims associated with them. Here's how the process would ideally work for the given scenario:\n\n1. **Entity Extraction**:\n   - The entity specification is received. Let's say it is a list of company names: \"Company X,\" \"Company Y,\" and \"Company Z.\"\n   - The text document is scanned, and all instances of these company names are identified. This would be done using natural language processing techniques such as named entity recognition.\n\n2. **Claim Extraction**:\n   - For each identified entity, the text surrounding the entity is analyzed to extract claims. A claim is typically a statement that attributes an action or a state to an entity.\n   - The claim description is used as a guide to identify the type of claims to look for. For example, if the claim description is \"violated environmental regulations,\" then the system would look for sentences indicating that the entity has committed such a violation.\n   - The following information is extracted for each claim:\n     - **Subject**: The name of the entity that is the subject of the claim.\n     - **Object**: The entity that is affected by or involved in the claim, if applicable.\n     - **Claim Type**: The category of the claim, such as \"Environmental Violation.\"\n     - **Claim Status**: This is determined based on the evidence in the text. If the claim is stated as a fact, it might be marked as TRUE. If it is alleged or speculative, it might be SUSPECTED. If there is evidence refuting the claim, it would be FALSE.\n     - **Claim Description**: A detailed explanation of the claim, including the reasoning and any evidence provided in the text.\n     - **Claim Date**: The period during which the claim was made, if provided.\n     - **Claim Source Text**: The actual text from the document that supports the claim.\n\n3. **Output**:\n   - The claims are formatted as per the given structure and returned as a list.\n\nHere's an example of how the output might look:\n\n```\n- (Company X|NONE|Environmental Violation|TRUE|2022-01-01|2022-01-01|Company X was found to have exceeded emission limits in their manufacturing process.|\"According to the report, Company X's emissions exceeded the permissible limits set by the environmental regulations.\")\n- (Company Y|Company Z|Antitrust Violation|SUSPECTED|2022-03-15|2022-03-20|Company Y is suspected of colluding with Company Z to manipulate market prices.|\"There are indications that Company Y and Company Z may have colluded to control the market prices, an act that raises concerns of antitrust violation.\")\n```\n\nIn this hypothetical example, \"Company X\" is the subject of a claim of an environmental violation, while \"Company Y\" and \"Company Z\" are involved in a suspected antitrust violation. The dates indicate when the claims were made or relevant to, and the claim source text provides the context from the document.", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

It was replaced by a temporary Terminal 4 built in 1984. The terminal was connected to Terminal 2 by a glass-enclosed hallway. It had a Y shaped concourse similar to Concourses H/K in Terminal 3. \n\nConcourse A (Terminal 1)\n\nOld Terminal 1 also had a satellite Concourse A that served commuter airlines. Among the airlines that used to operate from this terminal were Air France, El Al, Icelandair, Mexicana de Aviaci√≥n, Pan Am and Sabena. \n\nConcourse D (Terminal 2)\n\nA Concourse D in Terminal 2 previously existed and served as the concourse for AirCal, Air Wisconsin, Braniff, Continental, Eastern, Frontier Airlines, Northwest Orient, People Express, Piedmont and United Express until it was demolished in 1988 to make room for the current Terminal 1 concourses. It consisted of 12 gates.\n\nTerminal 4\n\nDue to the construction of Terminal 1 for United, all international arrivals and some international departures were relocated to a temporary Terminal 4 from 1984 until 1993. Terminal 4 was located on the ground floor of the main parking garage; departing and arriving passengers were transported by bus to and from their aircraft.  The terminal served many international carriers during this time, but was inadequate both in terms of operating area and bus loading/unloading capacity. \n\nGround for the new US$618 million International Terminal was broken on July 11, 1990 with airline executives and government officials, led by Mayor Richard M. Daley and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner, in attendance.  The new Terminal 5, designed by Perkins and Will in conjunction with Heard & Associates and Consoer Townsend & Associates  partially opened on May 27, 1993 with its two lower levels completed to handle all international arrivals.  The rest of the terminal, including the departures level, opened on September 30, 1993.  The \"Terminal 5\" name was used for this new terminal in order to avoid confusion with the old Terminal 4.\n\nSince the opening of Terminal 5, Terminal 4 has been made into the airport's facility for regional transit buses, hotel shuttles, and other ground transportation; the Terminal 4 designation may be used again in the future as new terminals are developed. The CTA Blue Line was extended to the airport in 1984.\n\nAirlines and destinations\n\nPassenger\n\nNote: All international arrivals, except for arrivals from airports with U.S. customs preclearance, are serviced at Terminal 5, regardless of the listed departure terminal.\n\n United's check-in and baggage claim is located at Terminal 1 but uses Concourses E and F, which are part of Terminal 2.\n\nProspective flights\n \nAmerican Airlines is planning to restart operations to India from the U.S. However, it is not yet known which airline hub American will fly to nonstop from Delhi. AA had pulled out of the Delhi route in early 2012 after its parent company filed for bankruptcy. Currently, only Air India and United Airlines have direct flights between India and the U.S. \n\nThe Vice Chairman of Air Serbia said, they could offer flights to Chicago and Toronto from Belgrade in two to three years after it establishes itself in the U.S. market. Air Serbia launched a New York-JFK route on June 23, 2016. \n\nEthiopian Airlines is planning on expanding its U.S. long-haul network as it takes delivery of its new Airbus A350-900 and Boeing 787-8 aircraft. Ethiopian is looking at possible flights to Chicago and Houston from Addis Ababa after launching its new service to Newark, which could be launched in 2017. \n\nInterjet intends to expand to various cities in the United States  including Chicago.  The carrier currently flies to five destinations in the U.S. including Houston, Las Vegas, San Antonio, Miami, and New York. Oneworld has stated that it is interested in recruiting an airline from Mexico, preferably Interjet, to fill in the void left by Mexicana de Aviaci√≥n. In 2014, several Oneworld airlines signed codeshare agreements with the Mexican carrier including American Airlines \n\nPhilippine Airlines announced a U.S. expansion plan in which its fifth mainland U.S. destination would most likely be Chicago. The carrier has previously served Chicago via Honolulu (once weekly) and San Francisco (twice weekly) on a Boeing 747-200 in the 1980s. PAL would operate on a nonstop flight from Manila on a Boeing 777-300ER or a new higher gross weight version of the A350-900.  \n\nQantas has expressed interest in servicing Chicago from Sydney with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, ever growing their Trans-Pacific joint venture agreement with Oneworld partner American Airlines. \n\nTAP Portugal intends to expand operations to 10 more U.S. destinations.  TAP announced new service to Boston and New York-JFK, beginning this summer. Both routes will be operated with new Airbus A330 aircraft, to be delivered in June.  As TAP takes delivery more long-haul aircraft they are considering adding flights to Washington and Chicago from their hub in Lisbon. \n\nCargo\n\nThere are two main cargo areas at O'Hare that have warehouse, build-up/tear-down and aircraft parking facilities. The Southwest Cargo Area, adjacent to Irving Park Road, accommodates over 80% of the airport's all-cargo flights, divided among 9 buildings in two tiers. The North Cargo Area, which is a modest conversion of the former military base (the 1943 Douglas plant area), also receives air freighters. It is adjacent to the northern\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4", "temperature": 0.95, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 0.7, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
