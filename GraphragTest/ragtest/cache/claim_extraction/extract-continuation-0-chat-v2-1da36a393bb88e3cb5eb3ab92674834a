These can then be quickly converted into their active hormone form in response to a particular stimulus.\n\nEicosanoids are considered to act as local hormones.\n\nReceptors \n\n Most hormones initiate a cellular response by initially binding to either cell membrane associated or intracellular receptors. A cell may have several different receptor types that recognize the same hormone but activate different signal transduction pathways, or a cell may have several different receptors that recognize different hormones and activate the same biochemical pathway.\n\nReceptors for most peptide as well as many eicosanoid hormones are embedded in the plasma membrane at the surface of the cell and the majority of these receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) class of seven alpha helix transmembrane proteins.  The interaction of hormone and receptor typically triggers a cascade of secondary effects within the cytoplasm of the cell, often involving phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of various other cytoplasmic proteins, changes in ion channel permeability, or increased concentrations of intracellular molecules that may act as secondary messengers (e.g., cyclic AMP). Some protein hormones also interact with intracellular receptors located in the cytoplasm or nucleus by an intracrine mechanism.\n\nFor steroid or thyroid hormones, their receptors are located inside the cell within the cytoplasm of the target cell. These receptors belong to the  nuclear receptor family of ligand-activated transcription factors. To bind their receptors, these hormones must first cross the cell membrane. They can do so because they are lipid-soluble. The combined hormone-receptor complex then moves across the nuclear membrane into the nucleus of the cell, where it binds to specific DNA sequences, regulating the expression of certain genes, and thereby increasing the levels of the proteins encoded by these genes. However, it has been shown that not all steroid receptors are located inside the cell. Some are associated with the plasma membrane.\n\nEffects \n\nHormones have the following effects on the body:\n\n* stimulation or inhibition of growth\n* wake-sleep cycle and other circadian rhythms\n* mood swings\n* induction or suppression of apoptosis (programmed cell death)\n* activation or inhibition of the immune system\n* regulation of metabolism\n* preparation of the body for mating, fighting, fleeing, and other activity\n* preparation of the body for a new phase of life, such as puberty, parenting,  and menopause\n* control of the reproductive cycle\n* hunger cravings\n* sexual arousal\n\nA hormone may also regulate the production and release of other hormones. Hormone signals control the internal environment of the body through homeostasis.\n\nChemical classes \n\nAs hormones are defined functionally, not structurally, they may have diverse chemical structures. Hormones occur in multicellular organisms (plants, animals, fungi, brown algae and red algae). These compounds occur also in unicellular organisms, and may act as signaling molecules,   but there is no consensus if, in this case, they can be called hormones.\n\nAnimal \n\nVertebrate hormones fall into four main chemical classes:\n\n* Amino acid derived – Examples include melatonin and thyroxine.\n* Peptides, polypeptides and proteins. – Small peptide hormones include TRH and vasopressin. Peptides composed of scores or hundreds of amino acids are referred to as proteins. Examples of protein hormones include insulin and growth hormone. More complex protein hormones bear carbohydrate side-chains and are called glycoprotein hormones. Luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone are examples of glycoprotein hormones.\n* Eicosanoids – hormones derive from lipids such as arachidonic acid, lipoxins and prostaglandins.\n* Steroid – Examples of steroid hormones include the sex hormones estradiol and testosterone as well as the stress hormone cortisol.\n\nCompared with vertebrate, insects and crustaceans possess a number of structurally unusual hormones such as the juvenile hormone, a sesquiterpenoid. \n\nPlant \n\nPlant hormones include abscisic acid, auxin, cytokinin, ethylene, and gibberellin.\n\nTherapeutic use \n\nMany hormones and their structural and functional analogs are used as medication. The most commonly prescribed hormones are estrogens and progestogens (as methods of hormonal contraception and as HRT),  thyroxine (as levothyroxine, for hypothyroidism) and steroids (for autoimmune diseases and several respiratory disorders). Insulin is used by many diabetics. Local preparations for use in otolaryngology often contain pharmacologic equivalents of adrenaline, while steroid and vitamin D creams are used extensively in dermatological practice.\n\nA \"pharmacologic dose\" or \"supraphysiological dose\" of a hormone is a medical usage referring to an amount of a hormone far greater than naturally occurs in a healthy body. The effects of pharmacologic doses of hormones may be different from responses to naturally occurring amounts and may be therapeutically useful, though not without potentially adverse side effects. An example is the ability of pharmacologic doses of glucocorticoids to suppress inflammation.\n\nHormone-behavior interactions \n\nAt the neurological level, behavior can be inferred based on: hormone concentrations; hormone-release patterns; the numbers and locations of hormone receptors; and the efficiency of hormone receptors for those involved in gene transcription. Not only do hormones influence behavior, but also behavior and the environment influence hormones. Thus, a feedback loop is formed. For example, behavior can affect hormones, which in turn can affect behavior, which in turn can affect hormones, and so on.\n\nThree broad\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the provided text, the entity specification includes 'organization', 'person', 'geo', and 'event'.
