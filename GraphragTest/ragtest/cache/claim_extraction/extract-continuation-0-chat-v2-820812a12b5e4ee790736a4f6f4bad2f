As the Great Depression progressed and Felix the Cat faded from the movie screen, Mickey's popularity would rise, and by 1932 The Mickey Mouse Club would have one million members.  At the 5th Academy Awards in 1932, Mickey received his first Academy Award nomination, received for Mickey's Orphans (1931). Walt Disney also received an honorary Academy Award for the creation of Mickey Mouse. Despite being eclipsed by the Silly Symphonies short the Three Little Pigs in 1933, Mickey still maintained great popularity among theater audiences too, until 1935, when polls showed that Popeye was more popular than Mickey.    By 1934, Mickey merchandise had earned $600,000.00 a year.  In 1935, Disney began to phase out the Mickey Mouse Clubs, due to administration problems. \n\nAbout this time, story artists at Disney were finding it increasingly difficult to write material for Mickey. As he had developed into a role model for children, they were limited in the types of gags they could make. This led to Mickey taking more of a secondary role in some of his next films allowing for more emphasis on other characters. In Orphan's Benefit (August 11, 1934) Mickey first appeared with Donald Duck who had been introduced earlier that year in the Silly Symphonies series. The tempestuous duck would provide Disney with seemingly endless story ideas and would remain a recurring character in Mickey's cartoons.\n\nColor films (1935–1953)\n\nMickey first appeared animated in color in Parade of the Award Nominees in 1932, however the film strip was created for the 5th Academy Awards ceremony and was not released to the public. Mickey's official first color film came in 1935 with The Band Concert. The Technicolor film process was used in the film production. Here Mickey conducted the William Tell Overture, but the band is swept up by a tornado. It is said that conductor Arturo Toscanini so loved this short that, upon first seeing it, he asked the projectionist to run it again. In 1994, The Band Concert was voted the third-greatest cartoon of all time in a poll of animation professionals. By colorizing and partially redesigning Mickey, Walt would put Mickey back on top once again, and Mickey would reach popularity he never reached before as audiences now gave him more appeal.  Also in 1935, Walt would receive a special award from the League of Nations for creating Mickey.\n\nHowever, by 1938, the more manic Donald Duck would surpass the passive Mickey, resulting in a redesign of the mouse between 1938 and 1940 that put Mickey at the peak of his popularity. The second half of the 1930s saw the character Goofy reintroduced as a series regular. Together, Mickey, Donald Duck, and Goofy would go on several adventures together. Several of the films by the comic trio are some of Mickey's most critically acclaimed films, including Mickey's Fire Brigade (1935), Moose Hunters (1937), Clock Cleaners (1937), Lonesome Ghosts (1937), Boat Builders (1938), and Mickey's Trailer (1938). Also during this era, Mickey would star in Brave Little Tailor (1938), an adaptation of The Valiant Little Tailor, which was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nMickey was redesigned by animator Fred Moore which was first seen in The Pointer (1939). Instead of having solid black eyes, Mickey was given white eyes with pupils, a Caucasian skin colored face, and a pear-shaped body. In the 40's, he changed once more in The Little Whirlwind, where he used his trademark pants for the last time in decades, lost his tail, got more realistic ears that changed with perspective and a different body anatomy. But this change would only last for a short period of time before returning to the one in \"The Pointer\", with the exception of his pants. In his final theatrical cartoons in the 1950s, he was given eyebrows, which were removed in the more recent cartoons.\n\nIn 1940 Mickey appeared in his first feature-length film, Fantasia. His screen role as The Sorcerer's Apprentice, set to the symphonic poem of the same name by Paul Dukas, is perhaps the most famous segment of the film and one of Mickey's most iconic roles. The segment features no dialogue at all, only the music. The apprentice (Mickey), not willing to do his chores, puts on the sorcerer's magic hat after the sorcerer goes to bed and casts a spell on a broom, which causes the broom to come to life and perform the most tiring chore—filling up a deep well using two buckets of water. When the well eventually overflows, Mickey finds himself unable to control the broom, leading to a near-flood. After the segment ends, Mickey is seen in silhouette shaking hands with Leopold Stokowski, who conducts all the music heard in Fantasia. Mickey has often been pictured in the red robe and blue sorcerer's hat in merchandising. It was also featured into the climax of Fantasmic!, an attraction at the Disney theme parks.\n\nAfter 1940, Mickey's popularity would decline until his 1955 re-emergence as a daily children's television personality.  Despite this, the character continued to appear regularly in animated shorts until 1943 (winning his only competitive Academy Award—with canine companion Pluto—for a short subject, Lend a Paw) and again from 1946 to 1952.\n\nThe last regular\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(DISNEY COMPANY<|>NONE<|>REDISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Disney Company reissues of the early cartoons tend to credit Walt Disney alone, potentially not acknowledging the contributions of other staff<|>Disney Company reissues of the early cartoons tend to credit Walt Disney alone.)\n##\n(WALT DISNEY<|>NONE<|>ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATION<|>TRUE<|>1932-01-01T00:00:00<|>1932-12-31T00:00:00<|>Walt Disney received an honorary Academy Award for the creation of Mickey Mouse in 1932<|>Walt Disney also received an honorary Academy Award for the creation of Mickey Mouse.)\n##\n(WALT DISNEY<|>NONE<|>SPECIAL AWARD<|>TRUE<|>1935-01-01T00:00:00<|>1935-12-31T00:00:00<|>Walt Disney received a special award from the League of Nations for creating Mickey in 1935<|>Also in 1935, Walt would receive a special award from the League of Nations for creating Mickey.)\n##\n(MICKEY MOUSE<|>NONE<|>ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATION<|>TRUE<|>1932-01-01T00:00:00<|>1932-12-31T00:00:00<|>Mickey received his first Academy Award nomination for Mickey's Orphans in 1932<|>At the 5th Academy Awards in 1932, Mickey received his first Academy Award nomination, received for Mickey's Orphans (1931).)\n##\n(MICKEY MOUSE<|>NONE<|>POPULARITY<|>TRUE<|>1932-01-01T00:00:00<|>1932-12-31T00:00:00<|>By 1932, The Mickey Mouse Club had one million members, indicating high popularity of Mickey Mouse<|>As the Great Depression progressed and Felix the Cat faded from the movie screen, Mickey's popularity would rise, and by 1932 The Mickey Mouse Club would have one million members.)\n##\n(MICKEY MOUSE<|>NONE<|>MERCHANDISING<|>TRUE<|>1934-01-01T00:00:00<|>1934-12-31T00:00:00<|>Mickey merchandise had earned $600,000.00 a year by 1934<|>By 1934, Mickey merchandise had earned $600,000.00 a year.)\n##\n(MICKEY MOUSE<|>NONE<|>PHASING OUT<|>TRUE<|>1935-01-01T00:00:00<|>1935-12-31T00:00:00<|>Disney began to phase out the Mickey Mouse Clubs in 1935 due to administration problems<|>In 1935, Disney began to phase out the Mickey Mouse Clubs, due to administration problems.)\n##\n(MICKEY MOUSE<|>NONE<|>DESIGN CHANGE<|>TRUE<|>1938-01-01T00:00:00<|>1940-12-31T00:00:00<|>Mickey was redesigned between 1938 and 1940, reaching the peak of his popularity<|>However, by 1938, the more manic Donald Duck would surpass the passive Mickey, resulting in a redesign of the mouse between 1938 and 1940 that put Mickey at the peak of his popularity.)\n##\n(MICKEY MOUSE<|>NONE<|>FEATURE-LENGTH FILM<|>TRUE<|>1940-01-01T00:00:00<|>1940-12-31T00:00:00<|>Mickey appeared in his first feature-length film, Fantasia, in 1940<|>In 1940 Mickey appeared in his first feature-length film, Fantasia.)\n##\n(MICKEY MOUSE<|>NONE<|>POPULARITY DECLINE<|>TRUE<|>1940-01-01T00:00:00<|>1954-12-31T00:00:00<|>After 1940, Mickey's popularity would decline until his re-emergence in 1955 as a daily children's television personality<|>After 1940, Mickey's popularity would decline until his 1955 re-emergence as a daily children's television personality.)\n##\n(DISNEY COMPANY<|>NONE<|>CONTINUOUS PRODUCTION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Disney continued the production of the Mickey series even after the departure of Iwerks and during the Great Depression<|>Disney and his remaining staff continued the production of the Mickey series, and he was able to eventually find a number of animators to replace Iwerks.)\n##\n(DISNEY COMPANY<|>NONE<|>TECHNOLOGICAL ADOPTION<|>TRUE<|>1935-01-01T00:00:00<|>1935-12-31T00:00:00<|>Disney Company used the Technicolor film process in the production of Mickey's first color film in 1935<|>Mickey's official first color film came in 1935 with The Band Concert.
