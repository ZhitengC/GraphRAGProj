In 2007, a star in the galactic halo, HE 1523-0901, was estimated to be about 13.2 billion years old. As the oldest known object in the Milky Way at that time, this measurement placed a lower limit on the age of the Milky Way. This estimate was made using the UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph of the Very Large Telescope to measure the relative strengths of spectral lines caused by the presence of thorium and other elements created by the R-process. The line strengths yield abundances of different elemental isotopes, from which an estimate of the age of the star can be derived using nucleocosmochronology. Another star, HD 140283, is 14.5 ± 0.7 billion years old and thus formed at least 13.8 billion years ago. \n\nThe age of stars in the galactic thin disk has also been estimated using nucleocosmochronology. Measurements of thin disk stars yield an estimate that the thin disk formed 8.8 ± 1.7 billion years ago. These measurements suggest there was a hiatus of almost 5 billion years between the formation of the galactic halo and the thin disk.  Recently Misha Hayward and his team at the Paris Observatory, through studying the chemical signatures of thousands of stars, have suggested that stellar formation may have dropped by an order of magnitude between 10 and 8 billion years ago. They suggest that this seems to have occurred at the time of disk formation, suggesting that the disc and barred structure by stirring up the gas made it too hot to form new stars at the same rate as before. \n\nDonald Lynden-Bell at Cambridge University in 1976  showed that the satellite galaxies surrounding the Milky way are not randomly distributed, but seemed to be the result of a break-up of some larger system producing a ring structure 500,000 light years in diameter and 50,000 light years wide.  Close encounters between galaxies, like that expected in 4 billion years with Andromeda rips off huge tails of gas, which, over time can coalesce to form dwarf galaxies in a ring at right angles to the main disc.  Pavel Kroupa,  and his doctoral student Pawlowski at the University of Bonn, studying the alignment of globular clusters and the whispy tails of the breakup of dwarf galaxies found they too formed part of such rings of matter.  In 2013 Rodrigo Ibata of the University of Strasbourg in France, has shown a similar ring structure exists around Andromeda Galaxy,  as a part of a coherent rotating structure, suggesting the Milky Way and Andromeda had interacted in the past.  But this is impossible even if we take account of the hidden dark matter haloes.  A subtle change such as that suggested by the MOND model allows for an interaction between the two galaxies 7–11 billion years ago.  Justin Koury of the University of Pennsylvania has suggested that if Dark Matter can involve a superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate it mimics the MOND model at certain states. \n\nEnvironment\n\nThe Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are a binary system of giant spiral galaxies belonging to a group of 50 closely bound galaxies known as the Local Group, itself being part of the Virgo Supercluster. The Virgo Supercluster forms part of a greater structure, called Laniakea. \n\nTwo smaller galaxies and a number of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group orbit the Milky Way. The largest of these is the Large Magellanic Cloud with a diameter of 14,000 light-years. It has a close companion, the Small Magellanic Cloud. The Magellanic Stream is a stream of neutral hydrogen gas extending from these two small galaxies across 100° of the sky. The stream is thought to have been dragged from the Magellanic Clouds in tidal interactions with the Milky Way.  Some of the dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way are Canis Major Dwarf (the closest), Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, Ursa Minor Dwarf, Sculptor Dwarf, Sextans Dwarf, Fornax Dwarf, and Leo I Dwarf. The smallest dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way are only 500 light-years in diameter. These include Carina Dwarf, Draco Dwarf, and Leo II Dwarf. There may still be undetected dwarf galaxies that are dynamically bound to the Milky Way, which is supported by the detection of nine new satellites of the Milky Way in a relatively small patch of the night sky in 2015. There are also some dwarf galaxies that have already been absorbed by the Milky Way, such as Omega Centauri. \n\nIn 2014 researchers reported that most satellite galaxies of the Milky Way actually lie in a huge disk, with almost all satellite galaxies moving in the same direction within this disk.  This came as a surprise: according to standard cosmology, the galaxies should form in halos of dark matter, be widely distributed and should move in random directions. This discrepancy is still not fully explained. \n\nIn January 2006, researchers reported that the heretofore unexplained warp in the disk of the Milky Way has now been mapped and found to be a ripple or vibration set up by the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds as they orbit the Milky Way, causing vibrations when they pass through its edges. Previously, these two galaxies, at around 2% of the mass of the Milky Way, were considered too small to influence the Milky Way. However, in a computer model, the movement of these two galaxies creates a dark matter wake\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(MILKY WAY<|>NONE<|>AGE ESTIMATE<|>TRUE<|>2007-01-01T00:00:00<|>2007-12-31T00:00:00<|>The Milky Way is estimated to be at least 13.8 billion years old, based on the age of the oldest known object in the galaxy, the star HE 1523-0901<|>In 2007, a star in the galactic halo, HE 1523-0901, was estimated to be about 13.2 billion years old, placing a lower limit on the age of the Milky Way.)\n##\n(MILKY WAY<|>NONE<|>FORMATION<|>TRUE<|>0880000000-01-01T00:00:00<|>0880000000-12-31T00:00:00<|>The galactic thin disk of the Milky Way is estimated to have formed 8.8 billion years ago, suggesting a hiatus of almost 5 billion years between the formation of the halo and the thin disk<|>Measurements of thin disk stars yield an estimate that the thin disk formed 8.8 ± 1.7 billion years ago.)\n##\n(MILKY WAY<|>NONE<|>FORMATION DECLINE<|>TRUE<|>10000000000-01-01T00:00:00<|>08000000000-12-31T00:00:00<|>Stellar formation in the Milky Way is suggested to have dropped by an order of magnitude between 10 and 8 billion years ago, possibly due to disk formation<|>Recently Misha Hayward and his team at the Paris Observatory, through studying the chemical signatures of thousands of stars, have suggested that stellar formation may have dropped by an order of magnitude between 10 and 8 billion years ago.)\n##\n(DONALD LYNDEN-BELL<|>NONE<|>DISCOVERY<|>TRUE<|>1976-01-01T00:00:00<|>1976-12-31T00:00:00<|>Donald Lynden-Bell showed that satellite galaxies around the Milky Way are not randomly distributed, but rather form a ring structure<|>Donald Lynden-Bell at Cambridge University in 1976 showed that the satellite galaxies surrounding the Milky way are not randomly distributed, but seemed to be the result of a break-up of some larger system producing a ring structure 500,000 light years in diameter and 50,000 light years wide.)\n##\n(PAVEL KROUPA<|>NONE<|>CONTRIBUTION<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Pavel Kroupa and his doctoral student Pawlowski found that globular clusters and the tails of dwarf galaxies form part of rings of matter<|>Pavel Kroupa, and his doctoral student Pawlowski at the University of Bonn, studying the alignment of globular clusters and the whispy tails of the breakup of dwarf galaxies found they too formed part of such rings of matter.)\n##\n(RODRIGO IBATA<|>NONE<|>DISCOVERY<|>TRUE<|>2013-01-01T00:00:00<|>2013-12-31T00:00:00<|>Rodrigo Ibata showed a similar ring structure exists around Andromeda Galaxy, suggesting past interaction with the Milky Way<|>In 2013 Rodrigo Ibata of the University of Strasbourg in France, has shown a similar ring structure exists around Andromeda Galaxy, as a part of a coherent rotating structure, suggesting the Milky Way and Andromeda had interacted in the past.)\n##\n(MILKY WAY<|>ANDROMEDA GALAXY<|>INTERACTION<|>TRUE<|>07000000000-01-01T00:00:00<|>11000000000-12-31T00:00:00<|>The Milky Way and Andromeda are suggested to have interacted 7–11 billion years ago, despite current distribution due to dark matter haloes<|>A subtle change such as that suggested by the MOND model allows for an interaction between the two galaxies 7–11 billion years ago.)\n##\n(JUSTIN KOURY<|>NONE<|>HYPOTHESIS<|>TRUE<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Justin Koury suggests that if Dark Matter can involve a superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate it may mimic the MOND model<|>Justin Koury of the University of Pennsylvania has suggested that if Dark Matter can involve a superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate it mimics the MOND model at certain states.)\n##\n(MILKY WAY<|>NONE<|>STRUCTURAL SURPRISE<|>TRUE<|>2014-01-01T00:00:00<|>2014-12-31T00:00:00<|>It was surprising to find that most satellite galaxies of the Milky Way lie in a huge disk, moving in the same direction, against the predictions of standard cosmology<|>In 2014 researchers reported that most satellite galaxies of the Milky Way actually lie in a huge disk, with almost all satellite galaxies moving in the same direction within this disk.)\n##\n(MILKY WAY<|>LARGE MAGELLANIC CLOUD<|>PHYSICAL EFFECT<|>TRUE<|>2006-01-01T00:00:00<|>2006-12-31T00:00:00<|>The warp in the disk of the Milky Way is caused by the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, which was previously unexpected due to their small mass<|>In January 2006, researchers reported that the heretofore unexplained warp in the disk of the Milky Way has now been mapped and found to be a ripple or vibration set up by the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds as they orbit the Milky Way.)\n##\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
