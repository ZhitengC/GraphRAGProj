Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

It was granted to the second wife of Napoleon I of France, Maria Luisa Duchess of Parma, a daughter of the Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, who was the mother of Napoleon II of France. Napoleon had divorced his wife Rose de Tascher de la Pagerie (better known to history as Josephine de Beauharnais) in her favour.\n\n*Maria Luisa 1814–1847 (→Family Tree)\n\nHouse of Habsburg-Lorraine: Emperor of Mexico \n\nMaximilian, the adventurous second son of Archduke Franz Karl, was invited as part of Napoleon III's manipulations to take the throne of Mexico, becoming Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. The conservative Mexican nobility, as well as the clergy, supported this Second Mexican Empire. His consort, Charlotte of Belgium, a daughter of King Leopold I of Belgium and a princess of the House of Saxe-Coburg Gotha, encouraged her husband's acceptance of the Mexican crown and accompanied him as Empress Carlota of Mexico.

Therefore, the kings of Hungary are listed separately.\n\nAlbertine line: Kings of Hungary\n\n* Albert, king of Hungary 1437–1439\n* Ladislaus V Posthumus, King of Hungary 1444–1457\n\nAustrian Habsburgs: Kings of Hungary\n\n* Ferdinand I, king of Hungary 1526–1564\n* Maximilian I, king of Hungary 1563–1576\n* Rudolf I, king of Hungary 1572–1608\n* Matthias II, king of Hungary 1608–1619\n* Ferdinand II, king of Hungary 1618–1637\n* Ferdinand III, king of Hungary 1625–1657\n* Ferdinand IV, king of Hungary 1647–1654\n* Leopold I, king of Hungary 1655–1705\n* Joseph I, king of Hungary 1687–1711\n* Charles III, king of Hungary 1711–1740\n* Maria Theresa, queen of Hungary 1741–1780\n\nHouse of Habsburg-Lorraine, main line: Kings of Hungary\n\n* Joseph II, king of Hungary 1780–1790\n* Leopold II, king of Hungary 1790–1792\n* Francis, king of Hungary 1792–1835\n* Ferdinand V, king of Hungary and Bohemia 1835–1848\n* Francis Joseph I, king of Hungary 1867–1916\n* Charles IV, king of Hungary 1916–1918\n\nKings of Bohemia \n\nThe kingship of Bohemia was from 1306 a position elected by its nobles. As a result, it was not an automatically inherited position. Until the rule of Ferdinand I, Habsburgs didn't gain hereditary accession to the throne and were displaced by other dynasties. Hence, the kings of Bohemia and their ruling dates are listed separately. The Habsburgs became hereditary kings of Bohemia in 1627.
