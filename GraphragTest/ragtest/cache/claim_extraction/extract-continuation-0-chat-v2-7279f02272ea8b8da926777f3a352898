Besides Gottfredson artists for the strip over the years included Roman Arambula, Rick Hoover, Manuel Gonzales, Carson Van Osten, Jim Engel, Bill Wright, Ted Thwailes and Daan Jippes; writers included Ted Osborne, Merrill De Maris, Bill Walsh, Dick Shaw, Roy Williams, Del Connell, and Floyd Norman.\n\nThe next artist to leave his mark on the character was Paul Murry in Dell Comics. His first Mickey tale appeared in 1950 but Mickey did not become a speciality until Murry's first serial for Walt Disney's Comics and Stories in 1953 (\"The Last Resort\"). In the same period Romano Scarpa in Italy for the magazine Topolino began to revitalize Mickey in stories that brought back the Phantom Blot and Eega Beeva along with new creations such as the Atomo Bleep-Bleep. While the stories at Western Publishing during the Silver Age emphasized Mickey as a detective in the style of Sherlock Holmes, in the modern era several editors and creators have consciously undertaken to depict a more vigorous Mickey in the mold of the classic Gottfredson adventures. This renaissance has been spearheaded by Byron Erickson, David Gerstein, Noel Van Horn, Michael T. Gilbert and César Ferioli.\n\nIn Europe, Mickey Mouse became the main attraction of a number of comics magazines, the most famous being Topolino in Italy from 1932 on, Le Journal de Mickey in France from 1934 on, Don Miki in Spain and the Greek Miky Maous.\n\nMickey was the main character for the series MM Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine, published in Italy from 1999 to 2001.\n\nIn 2006, he appeared in the Italian fantasy comic saga Wizards of Mickey.\n\nIn 1958, Mickey Mouse was introduced to the Arab world through another comic book called “Sameer”. Mickey Mouse became so popular in Egypt that he got a comic book with his name. Mickey’s comics in Egypt are licensed by Disney and were published since 1959 by “Dar Al-Hilal” and they were a big hit, but unfortunately Dar Al-Hilal stopped the publication in 2003 because of problems with Disney, luckily the comics were re-released by \"Nahdat Masr\" in 2004 and the first issues were sold out in less than 8 hours. \n\nMerchandising\n\nSince his early years Mickey Mouse has been licensed by Disney to appear on many different kinds of merchandise. Mickey was produced as plush toys and figurines, and Mickey's image has graced almost everything from T-shirts to lunch boxes. Largely responsible for Disney merchandising in the 1930s was Kay Kamen (d. 1949) who was called a \"stickler for quality.\" Kamen was recognized by The Walt Disney Company as having a significant part in Mickey's rise to stardom and was named a Disney Legend in 1998.  At the time of his 80th anniversary celebration in 2008, Time declared Mickey Mouse one of the world's most recognized characters, even when compared against Santa Claus.  Disney officials have stated that 98% of children aged 3–11 around the world are at least aware of the character.\n\nMickey was most famously featured on wrist watches and alarm clocks, typically utilizing his hands as the actual hands on the face of the clock. The first Mickey Mouse watches were manufactured in 1933 by the Ingersoll Watch Company. The seconds were indicated by a turning disk below Mickey. The first Mickey watch was sold at the Century of Progress in Chicago, 1933 for $3.75. Mickey Mouse watches have been sold by other companies and designers throughout the years, including Timex, Elgin, Helbros, Bradley, Lorus, and Gérald Genta  The fictional character Robert Langdon from Dan Brown's novels was said to wear a Mickey Mouse watch as a reminder \"to stay young at heart.\" \n\nIn 1989, Milton Bradley released the electronic-talking game titled Mickey Says, with three modes featuring Mickey Mouse as its host. Mickey also appeared in other toys and games, including the Worlds of Wonder-released The Talking Mickey Mouse.\n\nFisher-Price has recently produced a line of talking animatronic Mickey dolls including \"Dance Star Mickey\" (2010)  and \"Rock Star Mickey\" (2011). \n\nIn total, approximately 40% of Disney's revenues for consumer products are derived from Mickey Mouse merchandise, with revenues peaking in 1997.\n\nMickey at the Disney parks\n\nAs the official Walt Disney mascot, Mickey has played a central role in the Disney parks since the opening of Disneyland in 1955. As with other characters, Mickey is often portrayed by a non-speaking costumed actor. In this form he has participated in ceremonies and countless parades. A popular activity with guests is getting to meet and pose for photographs with the mouse. As of the presidency of Barack Obama (who jokingly referred to him as \"a world leader who has bigger ears than me\")  Mickey has met every U.S. President since Harry Truman, with the exception of Lyndon B. Johnson. \n\nMickey also features in several specific attractions at the Disney parks. Mickey's Toontown (Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland) is a themed land which is a recreation of Mickey's neighborhood. Buildings are built in a cartoon style and guests can visit Mickey or Minnie's houses, Donald Duck's boat, or Goofy's garage. This is a common place to meet the characters. \n\nMickey's PhilharMagic (Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland) is a 4D film which features Mickey in the familiar role of sym\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(MICKEY MOUSE<|>TOPOLINO<|>PUBLICATION<|>TRUE<|>1932-01-01T00:00:00<|>PRESENT<|>Mickey Mouse became the main attraction of a number of comics magazines, including Topolino in Italy starting from 1932.||In Europe, Mickey Mouse became the main attraction of a number of comics magazines, the most famous being Topolino in Italy from 1932 on, Le Journal de Mickey in France from 1934 on, Don Miki in Spain and the Greek Miky Maous.)\n\n##\n(MICKEY MOUSE<|>DELL COMICS<|>PUBLICATION<|>TRUE<|>1950-01-01T00:00:00<|>1953-12-30T00:00:00<|>Paul Murry's first Mickey tale appeared in 1950 but Mickey did not become a specialty until Murry's first serial for Walt Disney's Comics and Stories in 1953.||His first Mickey tale appeared in 1950 but Mickey did not become a speciality until Murry's first serial for Walt Disney's Comics and Stories in 1953 (\"The Last Resort\").)\n\n##\n(MICKEY MOUSE<|>WESTERN PUBLISHING<|>PUBLICATION<|>TRUE<|>1950-01-01T00:00:00<|>PRESENT<|>During the Silver Age, the stories at Western Publishing emphasized Mickey as a detective in the style of Sherlock Holmes.||While the stories at Western Publishing during the Silver Age emphasized Mickey as a detective in the style of Sherlock Holmes, in the modern era several editors and creators have consciously undertaken to depict a more vigorous Mickey in the mold of the classic Gottfredson adventures.)\n\n##\n(MICKEY MOUSE<|>MM MICKEY MOUSE MYSTERY MAGAZINE<|>PUBLICATION<|>TRUE<|>1999-01-01T00:00:00<|>2001-12-30T00:00:00<|>Mickey was the main character for the series MM Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine, published in Italy from 1999 to 2001.||Mickey was the main character for the series MM Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine, published in Italy from 1999 to 2001.)\n\n##\n(MICKEY MOUSE<|>WIZARDS OF MICKEY<|>PUBLICATION<|>TRUE<|>2006-01-01T00:00:00<|>2006-12-30T00:00:00<|>Mickey appeared in the Italian fantasy comic saga Wizards of Mickey in 2006.||In 2006, he appeared in the Italian fantasy comic saga Wizards of Mickey.)\n\n##\n(MICKEY MOUSE<|>SAMEER<|>PUBLICATION<|>TRUE<|>1958-01-01T00:00:00<|>PRESENT<|>Mickey Mouse was introduced to the Arab world through another comic book called “Sameer” and became popular, with licensed comics published since 1959.||In 1958, Mickey Mouse was introduced to the Arab world through another comic book called “Sameer”.
