{"result": "Based on the provided text, there are no explicit entities that directly match the entity specification of 'organization', 'person', 'geo', or 'event', and there are no specific claims made against such entities. The text is a scientific explanation of hormone-behavior interactions and the comparison with neurotransmitters, and it does not contain the type of information that fits the activity's target of extracting claims against named entities.\n\nHowever, for the sake of the exercise, if we were to interpret the text in the context of the activity, the closest we could get to identifying a claim would be the statements about the discovery of hormones and endocrine signaling. But this still does not fit into the entity specification provided.\n\nGiven this, the most appropriate output would be:\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nSince there are no entities or claims that match the description and entity specification provided. If you would like me to re-examine the text or provide a different interpretation, please let me know.", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

Not only do hormones influence behavior, but also behavior and the environment influence hormones. Thus, a feedback loop is formed. For example, behavior can affect hormones, which in turn can affect behavior, which in turn can affect hormones, and so on.\n\nThree broad stages of reasoning may be used when determining hormone-behavior interactions:\n* The frequency of occurrence of a hormonally dependent behavior should correspond to that of its hormonal source\n* A hormonally dependent behavior is not expected if the hormonal source (or its types of action) is non-existent\n* The reintroduction of a missing behaviorally dependent hormonal source (or its types of action) is expected to bring back the absent behavior\n\nComparison with neurotransmitters \n\nThere are various clear distinctions between hormones and neurotransmitters:\n* A hormone can perform functions over a larger spatial and temporal scale than can a neurotransmitter.\n* Hormonal signals can travel virtually anywhere in the circulatory system, whereas neural signals are restricted to pre-existing nerve tracts\n* Assuming the travel distance is equivalent, neural signals can be transmitted much more quickly (in the range of milliseconds) than can hormonal signals (in the range of seconds, minutes, or hours). Neural signals can be sent at speeds up to 100 meters per second.\n* Neural signalling is an all-or-nothing (digital) action, whereas hormonal signalling is an action that can be continuously variable as dependent upon hormone concentration\n\nDiscovery\n\nThe discovery of hormones and endocrine signaling occurred during studies of how the digestive system regulates its activities, as explained at Secretin ยง Discovery.\nAnswer these questions:\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "glm-4", "temperature": 0.95, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 0.7, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
